The elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum, his body covered in baffling symbols. As Langdon and gifted French cryptologist Sophie Neveu sort through the bizarre riddles, they are stunned to discover a trail of clues hidden in the works of Leonardo da Vinci clues visible for all to see and yet ingeniously disguised by the painter.\n\nEven more startling, the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion a secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci and he guarded a breathtaking historical secret.

        "bio": "Dan Brown is the author of numerous #1 bestselling novels, including The Da Vinci Code, which has become one of the best selling novels of all time as well as the subject of intellectual debate among readers and scholars. Brown s novels are published in 52 languages around the world with 200 million copies in print.\n\nIn 2005, Brown was named one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World by TIME Magazine, whose editors credited him with  keeping the publishing industry afloat; renewed interest in Leonardo da Vinci and early Christian history; spiking tourism to Paris and Rome; a growing membership in secret societies; the ire of Cardinals in Rome; eight books denying the claims of the novel and seven guides to read along with it; a flood of historical thrillers; and a major motion picture franchise. \n\nThe son of a mathematics teacher and a church organist, Brown was raised on a prep school campus where he developed a fascination with the paradoxical interplay between science and religion. These themes eventually formed the backdrop for his books. He is a graduate of Amherst College and Phillips Exeter Academy, where he later returned to teach English before focusing his attention full time to writing.\n\nBrown is currently at work on a new book as well as the Columbia Pictures film version of his most recent novel."

            "content": "Four stars for pure entertainment value.\n\nHowever, Dave Barry's review gets five stars:\n\n\n`The Da Vinci Code,' cracked\nby Dave Barry\n\nI have written a blockbuster novel. My inspiration was The DaVinci Code by Dan Brown, which has sold 253 trillion copies in hardcover because it's such a compelling page-turner. NOBODY can put this book down:\n\nMOTHER ON BEACH: Help! My child is being attacked by a shark!\n\nLIFEGUARD (looking up from The DaVinci Code: Not now! I just got to page 243, where it turns out that one of the men depicted in ''The Last Supper'' is actually a woman!\n\nMOTHER: I know! Isn't that incredible? And it turns out that she's . . .\n\nSHARK (spitting out the child): Don't give it away! I'm only on page 187!\n\nThe key to The DaVinci Code is that it's filled with startling plot twists, and almost every chapter ends with a ''cliffhanger,'' so you have to keep reading to see what will happen. Using this formula, I wrote the following blockbuster novel, titled The Constitution Conundrum. It's fairly short now, but when I get a huge publishing contract, I'll flesh it out to 100,000 words by adding sentences.\n\nCHAPTER ONE: Handsome yet unmarried historian Hugh Heckman stood in the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C., squinting through the bulletproof glass at the U.S. Constitution. Suddenly, he made an amazing discovery.\n\n''My God!'' he said, out loud. ``This is incredible! Soon I will say what it is.''\n\nCHAPTER TWO: ''What is it?'' said a woman Heckman had never seen before who happened to be standing next to him. She was extremely beautiful, but wore glasses as a sign of intelligence.\n\n''My name is Desiree Legume,'' she said.\n\nHeckman felt he could trust her.\n\n''Look at this!'' he said, pointing to the Constitution.\n\n''My God, that's incredible!'' said Desiree. ``It's going to be very surprising when we finally reveal what we're talking about!''\n\nCHAPTER THREE: ''Yes,'' said Hugh, ``incredible as it seems, there are extra words written in the margin of the U.S. Constitution, and nobody ever noticed them until now! They appear to be in some kind of code.''\n\n''Let me look,'' said Desiree. ``In addition to being gorgeous, I am a trained codebreaker. Oh my God!''\n\n''What is it?'' asked Hugh in an excited yet concerned tone of voice. ''The message,'' said Desiree, ``is . . . ''\n\nBut just then, the chapter ended.\n\nCHAPTER FOUR: ''It's a fiendishly clever code,'' explained Desiree. 'As you can see, the words say: `White House White House Bo Bite House, Banana Fana Fo Fite House, Fe Fi Mo Mite House, White House.' ''\n\n''Yes,'' said Hugh, frowning in bafflement. ``But what can it possibly mean?''\n\n''If I am correct,'' said Desiree, ``it is referring to . . . the White House!''\n\n''My God!'' said Hugh. ``That's where the president lives! Do you think . . . ''\n\n''Do I think what?'' said Desiree.\n\n''I don't know,'' said Hugh. ``But we're about to find out.''\n\nCHAPTER FIVE: Hugh and Desiree crouched in some bushes next to the Oval Office.\n\n''We'd better hurry up and solve this mystery,'' remarked Desiree anxiously. ''It's only a matter of time before somebody notices that the Constitution is missing.'' She had slipped it into her purse at the National Archives while the guard wasn't looking.\n\n''The answer must be here somewhere,'' said Hugh, studying the ancient document, which was brown from age and the fact that he had spilled Diet Peach Snapple on it.\n\n''Wait a minute!'' he said. ``I've got it!''\n\n''What?'' said Desiree, her breasts heaving into view.\n\n''The answer!'' said Hugh. ``It's . . .\n\nBut just then, shots rang out.\n\nCHAPTER SIX: ''That was close!'' remarked Desiree. ``Fortunately, those shots had nothing to do with the plot of this book.''\n\n''Yes,'' said Hugh. ``Anyway, as I was saying, the answer is to hold the Constitution up so that it is aligned with the White House and the Washington Monument. . . . There, do you see what I mean?''\n\n''My God!'' said Desiree, seeing what he meant. ``It's . . . ''\n\n''Hold it right there,'' said the president of the United States.\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN: '' . . . and so you see,'' concluded the president, ``you two uncovered a shocking and fascinating secret that, if it should ever get out, could change the course of history.''\n\n''Mr. President,'' said Desiree, ``thank you for that riveting and satisfying explanation, which will be fleshed out into much greater detail once there is a publishing contract.''\n\n''Also,'' noted Hugh, ``we may use some beverage other than Snapple, depending on what kind of product-placement deals can be worked out.''\n\n''Good,'' said the president. ``Now can I have the Constitution back?''\n\nThey all enjoyed a hearty laugh, for they knew that the movie rights were also available...\nShow more",

            "content": "PLEASE do NOT recommend The Da Vinci Code to me because you think it's brilliant. Please do not try to explain to me that it is a \"really interesting and eye-opening book.\" Just don't. Please.\n\nI've read Iain Pear, I heart Foucault's Pendulum, Dashiell Hammett is my hero, Alan Moore is My Absolute Favorite, I listen to Coil on a fairly regular basis, and cloak n' dagger secret society/Priory of Sion/Knights of Templar-tinged num nums make me a very happy girl... but if you truly believe that Brown's stupid airport thriller has ANY right whatsoever to be placed in the same category with Michael \"Wooden Dildo Dialogue\" Crichton, let alone Umberto Eco, kindly keep this opinion very far away from me, or the ensuing conversation we have will not be constructive or polite in any way.\n\nI loathe Dan Brown. I resent him for spoon-feeding the masses pseudo-intellectual \"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\" D-grade thriller shite under a pretense of real sophistication, and getting orally serviced by The New York Times for his effort.\n\nI'd heard that the novel was meticulously researched and contained some really interesting and controversial assessments of religious zealotry. Um, not really? Well, not by my Merovingian standards, anyway. :D\n\nLet's put it this way. If Dan Brown was teaching an Insurgent Christian Symbolism in Art and Literature 101 class at my local community college, I'd definitely have a different opinion about him.\n\nBut NO. Dan Brown is not a professor of anything but pap. He is a barely competent thriller writer who wrote an AWFUL book that I could not bear to finish because I felt my IQ plummeting a little further with every \"Let's Go to Paris! Guidebook\" description and blowhard authorial essay. Oh, don't even get me started about those cute soliloquies the main characters are so fond of delivering, ever so calmly, often while cops n' bovvers are chasing them.\n\nThe characters are weakly drawn. The dialogue is excruciating. The research is shoddy and self-serving at best. The plot, no matter how open-minded you are, is beyond ludicrous. It's laughable enough to be incorporated into the next Indiana Jones movie. That'd be sweet, dude.\n\nWhat really irks me are Dan Brown's sanctimonious interviews, wherein he shows off all of his priceless antiques while expressing his abiding convictions that the American public needs a \"deeper appreciation\" of art and history and culture. What a shallow, self-aggrandizing hypocrite. I'm all for fictional subversion of the dominant Catholic paradigm, but only if the subverter knows what the hell they're talking about. Brown DOESN'T. He's all \"la la la, connect the dots\" but the picture he comes up with is awkward and unconvincing.\n\nThe DaVinci Choad is a dead easy, nay, downright lazy read, and yet droves of people are patting themselves on the back for having read and *gasp* actually understood it. Like this is some spectacular achievement? WHY? What, because the slipcover describes it as \"erudite\"? Are you fucking kidding me?\n\nDon't believe the hype, kids. You are profoundly more intelligent than this holiday page-turner gives you credit for.\n\nIf you really, honestly, just plain liked the book, that's cool I guess. Maybe you also prefer Anne Geddes to Alfred Stieglitz, Kenny G to Sidney Bechet, John Tesh to Igor Stravinsky. Your prerogative. Just.... please don't try to tell me that this is \"fascinating\" or \"meaningful literature\". Frickin' read The Club Dumas or something. Then we'll talk, and I won't want to shoot myself in the face.\n\nAlright, glad I purged that poison from my system. Carry on.\nShow more",

            "content": "most of us have heard of this controverisal book. it takes an open minded person to read this and to remember it is just fiction. but it brings up a lot of important questions about the Christian church, and the loss of paganism and the respect of the Goddess or the Woman.\n\nI don't care if I am the only one who likes this book. it is my own truth, and i will think what i want to think. Dan Brown didn't LEAD me or anyone else. he OPENED our minds. simply and importantly...he was just a catalyst for different thinking. that is a good thing...poorly written or not.\n\nif you finish the book you will notice that Dan Brown even makes it clear to readers through his characters words, that he doesn't want to destroy christianity because it has done so much good for so many people, and if it works for them, let's let them continue to do what works for them. but find your own path.\n\nif you were or are a Christian ask yourself about the topics in this book. They are so eye opening. Jesus having a baby? totally possible...never thought of it before. never thought of it. is it true? who knows. Things like this are happening all the time today...Weapons of Mass destruction in Iraq? sound familiar? Maybe the church repressed information LIKE this because it was a threat to the church. totally possible. The catholic church creating the biblical canon with a political agenda to wipe out paganism? actually this seems to be a fact. women being oppressed due to the fear of religous zealot men in power losing their power...never looked at it that way. but this seems to be a fact too. is it helpful in broadening my perspective of the fact that christianity is just a religion made by fallible people. it sure is. does it open my mind to other faiths like paganism, judiasm, islam, bhuddism, and want to take the truths from all of them, and then THINK FOR MYSELF and figure out my own truth. it sure does...and that is what this book has probably done for many other people. why do you think Dan Brown's book was on the bestseller list for so long...and became a movie...obviously it was doing some good.\nShow more",

Will Langdon be able to figure out all of the clues?\n\nThe Da Vinci Code is structured in very short chapters which at first was refreshing but became old pretty fast. Instead of focusing on one major mystery with a bunch of players, there are a bunch of riddles to solve. Of course, I wasn t able to solve the riddles (alright well I did solve the first riddle because if I was guessing someone s password that would have been my very first try). The prose is simply horrible in this book. The sentences were very short.\n\nTo read this, you have to suspend reality (and not in a good way, yes, I m talking to you all of my fantasy friends!). There was always a car ready to whisk them away. The police were constantly outsmarted. Planes could easily be redirected in mid-flight. If you ask Langdon the most basic yes/no question, he would answer you with a full treatise. But apparently this is really quite an aphrodisiac because the women seem to just love this nerdy guy.\n\nThank you to everyone who participated in The Da Vinci Code Readalong!\n\n2023 Reading Schedule\nJan Alice in Wonderland\nFeb Notes from a Small Island\nMar Cloud Atlas\nApr On the Road\nMay The Color Purple\nJun Bleak House\nJul Bridget Jones s Diary\nAug Anna Karenina\nSep The Secret History\nOct Brave New World\nNov A Confederacy of Dunces\nDec The Count of Monte Cristo\n\n\nShow more",

            "content": "This is a pretty formulaic page turner, a fun quick read. Written at about the level of the average Nancy Drew mystery, it is best appreciated at that level. As far as the content, there are howlers on virtually every page (starting with the hero who looks like \"Harrison Ford in Harris tweed\" and is a \"Professor of Religious Symbology at Harvard\" -- good work if you can find it). You have to ignore very pulpy, cheesy writing to enjoy this romantic thriller.\n\nIntended as a book that a dedicated reader could finish in a day, or something you take to the beach and casually finish in a weekend, makes for a reasonable airline novel, so much so that it is often a bit clunky in its desire to ensure that no intellectual effort on the reader's part will be required. Here's a recurring example in this novel: a bit of unfamiliar terminology, say \"crux gemmata\" (jeweled cross) will will be explained on page N, then on page N+1, a character will finger his jeweled cross and explain, \"Oh, yes -- this is a crux gemmata.\" I've read dinner menus that were more demanding on the reader. My wife and I both read about a third of it in a day, sharing the same copy, and that's a full work day plus taking care of kids, bedtime, etc. That's also a kind of virtue, I guess -- it's fast and peppy.\n\nAs far as history goes, Dan Brown apparently thinks that \"most historians\" give credence to the hoary forgeries and frauds promoted in sensationalist best-sellers like . This author gets the best of both worlds: simultaneously claiming that \"it's just fiction,\" while introducing the novel with claims that the historical record contained within is \"fact.\" That claim is ridiculous. To pluck a random example, he spends some time talking about the Council of Nicaea, and incorrectly summarizes it as the origin of the doctrine of Christ's divinity by Constantine. He ignores the Arian controversy out of which it arose, which is like trying to explain the Treaty of Versailles without mentioning World War I. He ignores the documented fact, agreed upon even by the cheerleaders of the gnostics that he is sympathetic to, that the earliest gnostic doctrines held that Christ was *purely* God, and not really man -- the very reverse of the doctrine that serves as the linchpin of his novel's intellectual base (such as it is). This is a bad novel for weak or misinformed Christians, but anyone familiar with history should spot the train wreck of Brown's ideas a mile off.\n\nOh yes, and in Brown's world, Opus Dei has shadowy assassin \"monks\" (in real life, Opus Dei is not a monastic order -- there are no Opus Dei monks, let alone trained assassins), and the Catholic Church has been promulgating known lies as its central dogmas, promotes violence throughout the world, and has been retarding the progress of science and knowledge for 2 millennia. Brown leaves the reader with the impression that this, too, is a matter of settled historical record. Oh, but then again, it's just fiction. Except when it's not.\n\nIn general, if you're looking for a heady thriller wrapped around Christian arcana, I'd recommend Umberto Eco's excellent , not this dumbed down, by-the-numbers novel.\nShow more",

It s the mix of different topics that interest many people stirred together that make it entertaining for the ones who like art or thrillers, for atheists and religious people, for the ones interested in plot or characterization, it s just difficult to find someone who would immediately say that she/he isn t interested in one of the plot vehicles.\n\nUchronia, dystopia, or big history?\nIt doesn t just relativizes general history, but religious and political history in a way that makes it a prime example of the fact that history and holy texts are written by the winners.

Brown did more than Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens combined and multiplied could have done in centuries by reaching so many people and making them think about the legitimation of any kind of belief.\n\nReligious fan fiction\nImagine many people would start writing fanfiction like that about different religious texts, expanding universes with new and alternative prophets, letting the whole thing collapse into a parody of itself within years.\n\nHard vs soft science\nI tend to equate religious, economic, and political science texts for the simple reason that, as soon as there is one more truth, or in hard science, formulas, and equations, the others or even the own one must the wrong.

            "content": "A thriller devoid of pacing or exciting language. A mystery devoid of clues, foreshadowing, or facts. A tell-all of half-truths based upon a forged document written by a schizophrenic conman. A character-driven modern novel devoid of character. The second draft of Angels and Demons. Page-turning action thanks to the literary equivalent of pulling out at the moment of orgasm. A spiritual awakening built on new-age conspiracy theory. This book is many things, and none of them good, new, or interesting. However, it is an excellent litmus test for idealistic delusion.\n\nUpon the first reading, I must admit I found it a bit interesting, but then I turned the final page, and there was no bibliography. No explanation of how the author became familiar with all the concepts he claimed to 'faithfully portray'. He wrote this book and pretended it was a history book, and then refused to support it in any way. And any history you can't check up on is a bad one.\n\nHe's no better than James Frey. In fact, he may be worse, since I know people who base their religious beliefs on this book, whereas Frey's only crime was wishing he was Scarface. And really, what macho thirtysomething male doesn't?\n\nBrown had good reasons for hiding his sources: they were forged by con-man Pierre Plantard and snuck into the Bibliotheque National in Paris back in the seventies. And it's not like Plantard got away with it, either--the whole 'Priory of Sion' thing was debunked thirty years before this book was even written.\n\nThe artistic 'iconography' that figures heavily into the mystery is also completely made-up, and was declared ludicrous by an art history professor of my acquaintance. There are a lot of well-known symbols and allusions in classic art, but none of them resemble Brown's claims. The whole hinge on which the plot turns--the notion that an inverted triangle is automatically symbolic of women--makes about as much sense as declaring that the use of the swastika by 3rd century, BC Buddhists was proof that they were fascists.\n\nThe rest of Brown's book is filled with the sort of cliched religious conspiracies you get from your first year as a theology student. Not only that, but these conspiracies were already explored by better writers in and the .\n\nWell, I've already done more legitimate historical research on this review than Brown did in his whole book, so I guess I'll call it a day.\nShow more",

And that's Dan Brown's winning play in this convoluted secret (faux) history uncovered adventure with over-the-top antagonists, he gives us a story that could touch all our lives, and to a degree that we care about. Hey, and it got millions of people interested in Fibonacci Numbers; and in reading in general :) On first reading it's pretty gripping but by my third (this) read the bending of so many facts and or inclusion of so many conspiracy theories takes the gleam of the story for me, to be honest, so a Two Star, 5 out of 12 from me.\n\nShow more",

            "content": "OKAY PEOPLE someone let me in on the gag because between the cries of \"Greatest Book of Greaty Greatness EVER\" and the screams of \"Lamest Load of Lamey Lameness EVER\", my itty bitty brain is left very \n\nSo post Hype-a-ganza, I finally got around to reading this popular, polarizing, pop culture icon and thought it was .drum roll        FINE(sigh). It was a solid read with a slight lean towards the  eh  side of MEH and few moments of genuine  that s neat.  I don t see all the love and I don t see all the rage. Other than the obvious religious flavor of the content, it reminded me of your typical page-turning, popcorn beach read and I thought it accomplished its goal in decent, if unremarkable, fashion.\n\nNow I have a strict approach when it comes to religiousness so I am going to ignore the aspects of the story, though I can certainly see people on both sides of the fence having  epic rah rah  or  epic fail  reactions and I respect that. For me, it didn t move my needle much in either direction beyond my fondness for the  big hidden history mystery  which is something I generally really enjoy.\n\nThe plot of this one has been talked to death and beyond so rather than adding one more jelly bean to the jar, I thought I would just run down a few likes and dislikes about the story and leave it at that.\n\n\n\n1. : are just fully fun and I am a major sucker for plots concerning  shadow  histories and secret people doing secret things behind secret doors for reasons that are SHHHHHHH. I love a good conspiracy. Find me a rumor involving being a and using a secret banking pipeline running from through to the and laundering vast monies to be used to coordinate the sale of to a headed by who will then turn the city into a giant used for the testing of alien  cloning  technology    .and I am glued to my seat and ONE HAPPY FELLA.\n\n2. : As much as I love conspiracies in general, when you throw the Knights Templar into the mix, it s gonna perk me up better than a latte enema. I am always in favor of having them show up as a lynch pin to any massive global plot. The Knights Templar are like caramel on ice cream and just make a good conspiracy better. I had a lot of fun with the rehash of the Templar s place in the center of EVERYTHING.\n\n3. : I thought the major plot components themselves were interesting and I enjoyed following the hidden clues, messages, riddles and the tie in to all of the famous historical artifacts. It was fun. I also liked the  historical significance  of the search (i.e., the  big reveal ) and the implications to the world if revealed.\n\n\n\n1. : As much as I enjoyed the plot concept, the execution of the story was often frustrating and occasionally insulting. I m not talking about the clunky,  serviceable at best  prose as that s gotten enough play without my squirting lighter fluid on the bonfire. My issue is more with Dan feeling the need to  spoon feed  me details about his  oh so clever plot  so that my economy-sized brain could grasp it.\n\nFor example, there would be a  reveal  that I thought was interesting .and then Dan would exhaust me with explaining EXACTLY what that meant and EXACTLY what the implications were and make sure I knew EXACTLY what he had told me. I get it Mr. Brown, heard you the first time.\n\n2. : For a page turning, actiony thriller, there was just too much sideways movement of the plot and some really unnecessary amounts of plod to the narrative. Part of this has to do with the excessive  hand holding  Dan does with his audience mentioned above. However, there are also WAY too much time spent slowing down to take a look around and where we are and where we ve been. I started getting the impression that Brown was trying to hit a particular page count for the book and didn t have anything but filler to loan the pages with. This is never a good thing for this kind of story.\n\n3. : Not a big fan of the final resolution of the story and I found it very and a bit of a let down.

            "content": "5 stars to Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code. Most folks have seen the movie and probably not read the book. What a loss for them!\n\nThat said, I know a lot of people don't enjoy Brown's books, believing he is too commercialized and over-exaggerated in his style. While I can understand why someone may think that, I don't agree. I love the complexity of the story, the reality and the fiction, the test of character strength, the puzzles, the different view points. It completely absorbs me... so I fall into the category of those who love him and this style of writing, even if others think his writing isn't fantastic. Doesn't mean I don't love the more classic and richly written novels where it's the imagery and the words that win out, too.\n\nI had never heard of Dan Brown in his early years. I heard about the movie being made of the book and how it was coming out relatively soon. I looked it up and saw it had the \"treasure-hunter\" thrill appeal and decided to read the book before the movie could come out and warp my interpretation. So glad I did!\n\nIt's addicting. Growing up Catholic, I knew most of the religious detail, but once it weaved it art, literature, history and philosophy, I was just enamored with the story. Could it really be true? Maybe I'm related to Adam and Eve too!\n\nMagnificent story-telling. Quick adventure. Beautiful scenes and images. Brown exhibit's intensely good control weaving back and forth between each of the plots, sub-plots and mini-plots. It's as realistic of a treasure hunt as one can get if you are not an adventurer, archaeologist or exhibition-junkie.\n\nBut what took it to the next level for me was the amount of detail included for every component. It's the intricate of the intricate, relying on pure puzzles to move the story forward. Each new puzzle creates its own spark of drama directing readers to challenge what they do and do not know about Jesus, Mary Magdalene, languages, culture, locations, etc.\n\nIt hits so many different waves of appeal that I felt it was at the top of its game. And it probably only edged out because of how tight this story was. Definitely a must-read for the genre, for Brown and before watching the movie adaption.\nShow more",

This book seems to have changed the minds of many Catholics (my grandfather included) and Protestants alike. Granted, there have long been rumors of secret societies and organizations within the Roman Catholic Church, and historical cover-ups are rampant throughout civilization.\n\nHOWEVER,\n\nThe book is crap. It's not at all well written. Brown seems to feel that in order to impress the mystery of the supposed Holy Grail conspiracy upon his readers, he must be repetitive and condescending. It almost seems that the whole purpose of the book is to tell the world how much Brown knows about obscure art history and symbology, and that he is willing to explain it to the teeming masses of uniformed Christendom. His constant use of cliff-hanger chapter endings (almost every chapter) makes the novel read like it was originally intended as a serial publication. Much of Brown's story hinges upon the loss of the Sacred Feminine, and yet his main female character (a cryptologist for the French police) is constantly having to be led clue by clue to obvious conclusions by her quicker, more worldly, male counterparts.\n\nI might have put some stock into Brown's \"history,\" he writes with conviction, if not much style. I may even have looked into some of his sources on my own. Today, though, Brown completely lost any stock I would have put into his actual knowledge. He referred, multiple times, to Jesus Christ as the Immaculate Conception. As every half-informed Catholic knows, was the Immaculate Conception (conceived without sin), Jesus was the Conception (conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit).\n\nHow this novel came to be as popular as it is, I can understand. Everyone today is dying to get to the big TRUTH, something which can never be done in religion. Faith is by definition something that is unsubstantiated, we must just believe. What I can't understand is how people can believe this absolute drivel.\nShow more",

This detective story builds like a TV movie where a handsome guy and a girl strive to solve a schoolboy's riddles to discover the scandalous secret that everyone already knows. The fact that Jesus was a man, that he fucked Mary Magdalene and impregnated her (why not?), and that he was not God's son. Dan Brown was ignoring, in a novel that uses and abuses the notion of mystery, the mystery of the identity of Christ, true God, and true man.\nLet's move on. The Da Vinci Code is nothing more than a new version of Indiana Jones, in the American style, with the initial murder, the police error, the (so little) incredible escape of the heroes, the betrayal of the good guy becoming Machiavellian, the hidden microphones, two or three deaths lying around, the reunion of the lost grandmother and brother and the final kiss, prudish, without the slightest trace of eroticism. Yet, simultaneously, the whole book applies itself to magnify the Sacred Feminine.\nHow, then, to understand the dazzling success of this novel? Let's face it: I let myself take. This feeling of collaborating in the truth's discovery upsets the world's order by deciphering anagrams. This satisfaction of feeling oneself the discoverer as if the solution of a sodoku could collapse an entire civilization. At this little game, the end of the book can only disappoint. Nothing. This scum. Virgo worms. That's to designate only the cup, the chalice, and the Holy Grail. The real mystery is undoubtedly there: by what miracle can a little detective story of nothing become a world affair? Revealing this secret seems much more complicated than Dan Brown's treasure hunt.\nShow more",

            "content": "Every summer I tend to enjoy reading action and adventure thrillers. The genre seems perfect for the hot weather outside as all of the action builds to a heated crescendo. Last week I participated in a diary called the Pepys Project in one of the groups I am part of, the reading for pleasure book club. The diarist relays pertinent literary information on a daily basis to ones peers. It happened that author Dan Brown celebrated a birthday last week, and as I had never read his best selling DaVinci Code, the diary reminded me that the summer was a good as time as any to partake in this thriller.\n\nWorld renowned Harvard professor Robert Langdon is in Paris to deliver a lecture about his latest findings in cryptic symbology. As Langdon addresses his speech, nearby at the Louvre museum an albino monk on orders from his teacher brutally murders curator Jacques Sauniere. These two events are not mere coincidence as Sauniere had been planning on meeting with Langdon later in the evening. As he lay dying, Sauniere penned cryptic codes to both Langdon and his granddaughter Sophie Neveu. It would be up to the pair to crack these mysteries before the church uncovered the secrets that Sauniere had worked his entire life to guard.\n\nOnce Langdon and Neveu meet up, together they discover that Sauniere had been the grand master of the Priory of Sion, an ancient society which believed in an alternate true history of Christianity. Sauniere left the duo a trail of clues to find the true resting place of the holy grail, that is before Catholic fanatical sect Opus Dei beats them to it and destroys the information. Through a intricate web of surveillance and bribes, however, Paris of chief police Bezu Fache believes that Langdon and Neveu to be guilty of Sauniere's murder. Ensuing, is a race through Paris and London to ensure that the grail and its secrets do not fall into the wrong hands.\n\nBrown details centuries of religious symbols and information as he has Langdon and Neveu quest to keep the Priory's secrets safe. Along the way they meet a number of characters, never knowing if one is friend, foe, or double agent. As a result, the action is fast paced, intriguing, and even brain exercising as I thought alongside the pair to crack open the codes that Sauniere left for them. In a structure of short chapters and changing points of view, Brown created a story that grew more thrilling as it went on. This created for an entertaining denouement which read quickly to the end.\n\nWhile it remains to be seen if the mysteries outlined in The DaVinci Code are fact, fiction, or somewhere in between, Dan Brown has created a fun concept that makes for thrilling summer reading. The novel grew to be an international best seller and later made into a movie starring Tom Hanks. Even though movies are usually not as good as their novel counterparts, Brown's thriller should translate well onto screen as it is all action. The Pepys Project lead me to a summer reading adventure, which I rate 3.75 stars. I look forward to Dan Brown's next installment starring Robert Langdon.\nShow more",

            "content": "For the most part, it seems that people either passionately love this book or they passionately hate it. I happen to be one of the former. For my part, I don't see the book so much as an indictment of the Catholic Church in particular but of religious extremism and religion interfering in political process in general. The unwarranted political control granted to extreme religious organizations like the CBN is an issue that we will be forced to address one way or the other. To my eye, our political process has been poisoned by it and the danger of theocracy is quite real. Furthermore, Brown's indictment of the Church for removing or suppressing feminine divinity figures is justified and needs a much closer look. Women do not have enough of a role in religion, religious practice, heroic myths, and creation myths, nor are they portrayed as divinity figures enough. In short, our religious systems and institutions lack balance and have a bias to suppress issues, stories, and roles that empower women to live as equals to men. Finally, Brown wrote his story simplistically, in my view, to spread his tale to as broad an audience as possible. Though it is not as pristine a narrative as, say, Umberto Eco, the message it conveys is one that needs to be heard. More obscure books on the matter are not as accessible as Da Vinci Code and if someone were to write an accessible book of genius on this subject, I would give him/her all due praise. In the meantime, Dan Brown is telling a story that needs to be told. It is one that has been kept quiet and in the dark for far too long.\nShow more",

First of all, Mr. Brown, despite teaching English at Amherst College, is a bad writer. This is not to say that I am a good writer. But I recognize a person who can't \"show\" you vivid scenes, he has to \"tell you\". Various characters wear expensive clothes. How do we know? The text says they're expensive. How do we know Mr. Langdon is brilliant? The text makes no bones about telling us. Langdon is also famous. Blah.\n\nFurthermore, Mr. Brown's books are ridiculously formulaic. Every single \"thriller\" that he has written to date begins with the murder of a key character at the hands of a shadowy and \"terrifying\" assassin individual/group. This group is controlled by a larger group with dubious intentions that generally have to do with world domination. The protagonist is introduced as an \"expert\" whose credentials relate to the matter at hand, and who takes the job of hunting down the bad guys. He enlists the aid of an extremely avuncular, wise, benevolent helper. This person provides assistance as the protagonist (with a love interest) finds clues to the murder, attempts to find the bad guys, is pursued by the assassin(s), all while TIME IS RUNNING OUT. The avuncular father figure turns out to be pulling the strings of the assassins, is behind the original killing, and provides a forgettable monologue at the end where he pleas for understanding. But our hero takes him down. The end. I'm sorry if I just ruined all Dan Brown's books for you.\n\nFinally, Mr. Brown likes to write about what he sees as religious conflicts. These conflicts take place between believers and non-. Unfortunately, he proves unable to adequately and convincingly describe these conflicts, because he reveals a striking inability to understand why people believe, in the first place. His highly religious characters therefore invariably turn out to be crazed nutjobs. I don't like stories that exploit religion for entertainment, and then use the attention that they draw to this entertainment to subtly undermine the reasons for faith.\n\nBut by all means, read the Da Vinci Code. People say it's smart. Others describe it as a fast-paced thriller with historical and theological implications. It could've been in the hands of another author.\nShow more",

A desperate race through the cathedrals and castles of Europe. An astonishing truth concealed for centuries . . . unveiled at last.\n\nWhile in Paris, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is awakened by a phone call in the dead of the night. The elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum, his body covered in baffling symbols. As Langdon and gifted French cryptologist Sophie Neveu sort through the bizarre riddles, they are stunned to discover a trail of clues hidden in the works of Leonardo da Vinci clues visible for all to see and yet ingeniously disguised by the painter.\n\nEven more startling, the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion a secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci and he guarded a breathtaking historical secret. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle while avoiding the faceless adversary who shadows their every move the explosive, ancient truth will be lost forever.\n\n: Not one word. I mean it. Not ONE WORD of criticism for this book's three-star rating. It is not Literature, it is not even particularly well-written farb, but it is undeniably a page-turning rip-snorting adventure story that pokes fun at christian religion. Therefore it is A-Okay with me.\n\nSnobs: It's not about you. It's about normal people getting their entertainment from a book for once, instead of a TV or a gaming console. Why are you bitching? Who said you had to read it?\n\nLovers: It's not about how much you love it. I didn't love it. I read the whole thing in a sitting and I wasn't about to get up until it was done, and that's saying a lot for someone whose life list of books read includes the snooty people's snootiest books. So yeah, three-star review is a huge vote of confidence from this source.\n\nReligious christians: What in the hell are you doing reading my reviews?! Are you daft? I won't be saying anything nice about your imaginary friend any time soon. Pass on!\n\nEnvironmentalists: Yes, the entirety of Siberia was deforested to print the book in its zillions. I feel bad about that too. Tell you what: Get out there and make hemp paper (better for the environment, plus a smokeable side product!) on a commercial scale. Books will go down in price, forests will be saved, and the mellow quotient of the world will go up. Win-win-win!\n\nNormal people: You've all read the book by now, right? If not, go to a used bookstore (Brown's rich enough) and pick a few up. It's a lot of fun.\n\n\nThis work is licensed under a .\nShow more",

            "content": "Caveat Academics!!!\nI won't belabor the obvious, as it's been done quite well by other reviewers, but I just couldn't stand not to add my own \"hear hear!\" to the fray. If you're going to create a character who is an expert, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make sure you check your facts! Whoever edited this drivel ought to be sewn in a sack with a rabid raccoon and flung into Lake Michigan.\n\nAnd just as a matter of good taste - your expert should not be an expert in everything under the sun. That's one of the hallmarks of poor writing.\n\nEven if I were not a practicing pagan, I would find it stretching credibility that every single item the characters run across is a symbol of goddess worship. Five pointed star? Goddess worship. Chalice? Goddess worship. Porcelain toilet bowl? Goddess worship. Pilot ball point pen? Goddess worship. You get the general idea. Not only is every item part of the mythology of the divine feminine, but every number is also part of the divine feminine. Hello? Is a cigar NEVER just a cigar?\n\nAnd some of the claims of symbolism are just plain wrong, as the editor would have found out if he'd bothered to do some fact checking. Remember those military chevrons that, because of the way they were pointed, represented the female divine and those poor slobs of soldiers had been running around all these countless centuries with goddess symbols flaunted on their uniforms without knowing it? The only problem with that premise is that the chevrons facing in their current direction is relatively recent - according to my military historian husband, they faced the OPPOSITE direction for quite some time before being reversed (for what reason, I have no idea...unless the generals all got together and decided they didn't have quite enough goddess symbols on their uniforms and needed it fixed post haste).\n\nMy theology professor ended up traveling around the country giving talks about this book to thousands of interested people. He loves the book if only because he's now giving pretty much the same information that he used to give to dozing freshman and sophomores to packed theaters of interested listeners. He tells a story about being somewhere in southern Ohio and making a joking remark about the celice being something that all Catholics wore and how now the secret was out, and there was a lady in the back row who elbowed her husband and said \"See? I told you so!\" The increased interest in history is about the only positive thing that's come out of this book. Honestly, you don't need to make anything up about the Catholic church to point out that it's been the source of some horrible things.\n\nI could go on about the poor research and editing in this book, but others have done a pretty thorough job of finding the problems with it.\n\nIf you want a decent page turner, go for it. If you want something well researched and accurate, give this one a big ol' pass.\n\n\n\nShow more",

Within the black-and-white striped canvas tents is an utterly unique experience full of breathtaking amazements. It is called Le Cirque des R ves, and it is only open at night.\n\nBut behind the scenes, a fierce competition is underway a duel between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors. Unbeknownst to them, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will. Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into love a deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands.\n\nTrue love or not, the game must play out, and the fates of everyone involved, from the cast of extraordinary circus performers to the patrons, hang in the balance, suspended as precariously as the daring acrobats overhead.\n\nWritten in rich, seductive prose, this spell-casting novel is a feast for the senses and the heart.",

            "content": "Aw hell, I'm going to rate this 4.5 stars. I can't resist this book was so freaking good. I don't normally change my ratings, so don't expect this TOO often.\n\nMy feelings are so conflicted about this book. I don't know whether to immortalize it for all eternity in a frame on my wall, or throw it into the fire.\n\nSo, how the hell am I supposed to rate this book? A million stars, one star, 837 stars, what? In the end I did some crazy, overly complicated math that really makes so sense in my head, and came out with four (which I raised to 4.5 because I'm such a weakling) stars.\n\nFor the longest time during the book, over two hundred and fifty pages, I thought that I disliked this book for some very specific reasons, but this is where the confusing part comes in so hang with me for a second: once you get to the end, you realize that you only you hated those parts, and it was really all part of Morgenstern's brilliant plan!\n\nI know a few of you are probably giving me this look right now:\n\n\n\nDon't worry, though, I'll explain! Let me start by saying that this is a book you definitely have to read twice. The first time, you really aren't going to understand all of the nuances and parts of this story until, well, until it's way too late. That's something pretty special-and rare-about this book; it reminds me a lot of in that way. Let me try to elaborate with, since I know you guys love this sooooo much, ........\n\nMost books and/or series that you read these days, you pretty much know the whole plot (sometimes even books before the TSTL character does) and how it's going to end: in a predicable, sappy, cheezy, blah blah blah you've read it a million times kind of ending; sometimes even just a couple of pages into the novel. In , you really don't. The plot strings start out so loosely that you can see little to no connection to them besides the two obvious ones with Marco and Celia. You've seen loose strings before in many a sloppy novel, so you just dismiss out all of ones you deemed \"unimportant\" in your eyes and focus on Marco and Celia. Wrong move. You get more and more confused as the book goes on; what's with all the other POVs and time jumps? Really, just a general what the hell is going on? But that's not the truth; while you're so eagerly and attentively looking at your two little strings, Morgenstern brings all of those other little strings closer.....and closer......and closer together until, unbeknownst to you, she starts weaving them in with Marco and Celia. As I said, you're still in the dark about most of it, but you do notice that the book is getting better, but don't realize until there's only about forty pages left that, holy fucking shit, your two little strings that you started out with is now a huge, complicated, rope, but the book won't let you stop and analyze it. It carries you forward in a wave of sheer awesomeness as you devour every page. Then, you get to the end of the book, and your brain blows up. It literally blows into a million billion little pieces all over wherever you're sitting as your cat crawls all over you and nips your ankles (which is why I suggest you don't finish this book in a public place, because you will be incapacitated for several minutes and look like an invalid).\n\n\n\nWhen you finally get your brain back together, it almost blows up again when you realize that she planned for you to feel like this She's been playing you and has had you wrapped around her little pinky finger from the start. Like Great Expectations, you're never really going to understand the plot and all of the strings fully until you read it through twice, when you can really fully comprehend every little detail that Morgenstern wrote into this story.\n\nNow that I told you about how my brain exploded about twice, let me get on with this review and tell you what I was annoying:\n\nWhat I'm about to tell you right now is a joke. There are fricking POVs/main characters in this book that you're supposed to keep track of, and in case you still don't believe me, I'll list them for you:\n1.Marco\n2.Celia\n3.Tara Burgess\n4.Poppet\n5.Thessien\n6.Pospero\n7.Mr. Barris\n8.Isobel\n9.Bailey\n10.Chandresh\n11. Widget\n12. Mr. Murray\n13. Lainine\n14. Tante Padva\n15. Tsukiko\nThere are also chapters where she does it in POVs of other people from the circus, and sometimes she writes as though you're the one walking through it. Like I said, the first time you read through it, this can be very confusing and overwhelming, but once you read it through again, knowing the ending (and you can bet that I re-read this amazing book the second I was done with it) you truly understand these characters and why Morgenstern did it. And, no, I'm not going to tell you what at the end of the book made me change my mind so suddenly, you'll just have to read it yourself and be as astounded as I was. It's definitely worth waiting for.\n\n\nAwwww don't pout, I know you guys will love it!\n\nThe other thing that hurt my head about this book was the seemingly obsessive amount of date jumping. We go from the early 1890's, to 1895, to 1893, back to 1898, up to 1901, back to 1899, etc. It was very struggling to read; she be in 1895 for a chapter, jump around through years for 5 or more chapters, then go back to 1985 like I was expected to remember everything that happened before, and most of the time it would be with different people than the ones I'd read however many chapters ago. It was hard, let me tell you, but what pushed me through, the amazing life preserver that Morgenstern threw me, was the writing.\n\nOhhhhhh the writing *drools at the mouth*\n\nIt is seriously some of the best stuff I've ever had the pleasure to read and enjoy. And for those of you that know me and have seen some of my other reviews, you guys know that that doesn't happen much at all. It flows so perfectly, sounds so beautiful, and uses just some of the most gorgeous wordplay I've ever read. It truly is stunning. Here's some examples that just knocked the breath right out of my lungs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you guys aren't sold on the snippets I just gave you, then you're all nuts. Certifiably nuts.\n\nIn the end, I would recommend this book to almost anyone and everyone, as long as they actually know what an amazing book really is. If you're huge fans of these books: Hush, Hush, Twilight, Halo, Angel Star, etc, read nothing else but those, think that classics are stupid, out of date, books, and don't have enough patience to be able to truly enjoy a challenging book instead of just being half filled on pathetic YA tropes, then this book might be out of your league. But for everyone else, READ THIS NOW!.......... If you think I'm kidding.....\n\nI'm not.\n\nJust kidding!\n\nOr am I........?\n\nShow more",

            "content": "Contains some minor spoilers.\n\nI disliked this book, which means I ought to rate it one star, but it is not as awful as my one star shelf. One star books have to really repulse me to get that rating. The only redeeming thing about The Night Circus is that I didn't feel the one star compulsion to start a bonfire so I could properly dispose of it, hence two stars, but in this case it does not mean I enjoyed the book at all.\n\nFrom the Goodreads summary:\n\nThe above is a series of filthy, filthy lies intended to make you part with your money. Did the person who wrote the description read the same book I read? Or did he get so bored that he fell asleep and was forced to wing it for a deadline? If that's the case, I feel for the poor guy since I fell asleep reading this a few times, but I don't forgive the lies.\n\n\"A Fierce Competition\"\nInstead of reading about a battle of wits, ingenuity, and talent taking place on a magical field you get two slugs racing against each other... over the course of sixteen or so years. Yeah, all those extra years might kill the intensity, but think of the emotional investment you make in those slugs. You can bring your new born baby to see them and go again every year as the fierce competition between the two of them goes on and on and on and on and on...\nYour child will have a driver's license when the fierce competition is over.\n\n\"A Duel\"\nFor a significant part of the story the two 'dueling' magicians are raised separately with no knowledge of one another. For ANOTHER significant part of the story only one magician is aware of who they are 'competing' against. By the time the magician who was unaware is finally brought up to date they have been collaborating on projects for years... Yes, you read that right. They never stand toe to toe in any sort of competitive sense. They build little attractions for the circus and sometimes they built them together, leaving gaps for the other to fill because they like each other's work. This is how they 'fiercely compete' during their 'duel.'\n\n\"Trained Since Childhood Expressly For This Purpose\"\nThis sounds like a warrior toddler getting out of bed and doing push-ups (or the magical equivalent) every day for forever with the intent of search and destroy. In reality, they both have haphazard educations from sociopathic father figures* who never tell them a damn thing about the competition. They don't know what they're doing or how to play the game (and neither does the reader for most of the book). I believe this is because the author had no idea how to make them actually compete or what she was doing beyond establishing a lot of overly descriptive scene setting. The training is just education from two different schools of thought on the subject of magic. They're not given any idea of how to be the victor. It's an experiment, which is vastly different from training a warrior as this is made to sound.\n\n*The father figures are equally psychotic, suggesting that both of their philosophies are fundamentally flawed because they're both batshit crazy. One slices his daughter's fingers open over and over again to teach her how to heal herself, even smashes her hand to break her bones for a lesson, and the other does not know his ward's name until he is nearly an adult. Neither of them ever face any consequences for the things they do to the children or the many experimental children before them.\n\n\"Only One Can Be Left Standing\"\nAside from the obvious\nending the author works in, there's no reason that one of them has to die. The previous \"battle\" before this one (I'm sneering at that) lasted thirty-seven fucking years and only ended because one of the magicians committed suicide. There's absolutely no sense of urgency in this book. It moves at the languid pace my grandmother's overweight poodle used to meander around at, like there was no where to go and nothing to do. The author tries to force some urgency and pacing in by having both characters willing to lose the game so the other can win... but why? If you're playing a game of Monopoly with a friend (Monopoly might be too exciting a comparison to use here but lets work with it) and someone's going to need to commit suicide at the end of it then you... don't stop playing. You don't even have to sit at the board all day every day. You can come back once a year and make a fucking move. No one in their right mind would jump up and yell if you know your friend will jump up and say the same thing louder.\n\nI don't know what happens if no one commits suicide? Does someone self-implode from excess magic? We never find out anything substantial. We don't know how past competitions ended beyond that single one. The book is left open-ended so that the publishers can milk this monstrosity all over again if it sells well.\n\n\"Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into love a deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands.\"\nAfter many, many years of not knowing who the other magician is, Marco reveals himself to Celia. The author tells you sparks fly. Sparks do not actually fly because these two 'characters' are about as flat as they come. There's no resisting falling in love. They just decide to do it in true Edward/Bella/Twilight fashion. There's no \"deep, magical love\". The love story is next to non-existent. On top of that, Marco continues to see someone else for years after... why? I don't fucking know. But it's a big god damn deal because she goes nuts and disrupts some of the magic of the circus and allows Bad Things to happen.\n\nThere's so many other things wrong with the book. There's intertwining timelines. We jump back and forth decades in time, vanish off into characters who are at first totally unrelated to the circus and then have minor roles later on. None of the core characters are well-developed and none of the relationships are even remotely worth reading about. I don't get why the book is set in the period it was set in. Social standards aren't kept up. Maybe it was more atmosphere? Maybe it was so that the author didn't have to deal with the people who would show up to debunk the magic of the circus.\n\nOn that note, the magic was so obviously magic that I got annoyed. I feel slightly insane for typing that out, but hear me out. It's all supposed to be real magic done with a wink and a nod so people won't realize it's real magic. Turn a jacket into a raven and then grin and wave so people believe you just performed the best slight of hand ever. Of course, the tricks were too fantastical to be believed. The wooden animals on the carousel breathe... and no amount of great mechanics could have made that happen 100 plus years ago. There's ice gardens and foggy mazes , fires that never EVER go out, no one in the circus or relating to it ages (minus kids), and circus tents set up by invisible people. Everyone in the circus assumes the set up is done by assistants... what? assistants they never see? Where are the circus people when the set up and packing happens? Where do they think the crew goes after? Really, Book? Really?\n\nAll of this happened as a contest between two old men who do nothing but sacrifice the lives of children so they can have the satisfaction of being right about things that are One prefers things more obvious and in your face, the other is quiet and prefers a more book based education.\n\nThe world building and magic rules also suck. Anything the author wants to have happen can happen with minor limits. The only reason to read this book is the lovely descriptions and abundant scene setting. I do not recommend it to people who like a good story, although if you're into abundant prose give it a whirl. It's kind of like reading a travel brochure while high as a kite.\n\nEdit: To anyone who has not read the book and might be making their decision to read/not read based on this review, I wanted to say many people I respect found more redeeming qualities in the book than I did. one such review. Based on my experience, I still recommend reading sample chapters online first or a library trip.\nShow more",

            "content": " How can I excel at a game when you refuse to tell me the rules? \n\nI guess  The Night Circus  is one of those books that make it especially hard to write a proper review and if I m entirely honest I have to admit that I don t even know where to start. It was unlike any other book I ve ever read and therefore the usual structure of my reviews just doesn t seem to be appropriate, let alone to fit.\n\n\n\nTo use it for such a particular book would be as good as impossible and since I m no part of  Le Cirque des R ves  all I m able to do is to resort to the written word and to hope that it will suffice to convey all of my diverse emotions. And heaven knows there are plenty of them. ;-)\n\n\n\nJust like Herr Thiessen I shall forever be a  R veur , a Dreamer who looks at  The Night Circus  with wide eyes, getting lost in the intoxicating smell of the impossible and wonderful. I will wear my red scarf and explore the mysteries of this incredible and lovely place and as I walk down those countless tents and see all the different signs, I ll pray that it will never lose its charm.\nBecause places like that are special. They rarely or barely exist in the dull light of our daily world, the knowledge we soon will have to leave this venue only igniting our wish to stay.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want to experience the magic, want to marvel at its beauty and strangeness, at its impossibility and rareness.\n\n\n\nThe love between Celia and Marco is a never ending well of creativity, sweeping us off our feet, making us long for more. The details of their creations are incredible, the love and dedication they put into their work so delightful that we can t help but get lost in their tents. Each night we try to explore another one, sometimes we end up returning to those we already know.\n\n\n\nTo be one of the  R veurs  is a constant struggle, a never ending fight to find a balance between exploration and devotion. We want to indulge ourselves in the familiar, yet at the same time we want to surrender to the new. At a place that s made to be impossible literally everything seems to be feasible as long as you re willing to give it a try.\n\n\n\n\nThe only thing that never bends is time itself though. It slips through your fingers while you explore the circus, while you get lost in so many people s dreams. It runs out before you even know it, the intricate dancing clock merciless as it continues to tick.\n\n\n\nYou re too distracted to pay any attention to your surroundings though, too preoccupied with the performance of the red-haired twins. As the sun finally begins to rise, you realise that you have neither visited  The Ice Garden  nor  The Cloud Maze . There s only enough time left to do one more thing and you barely thought it before you re already standing in front of the last tent you re going to visit tonight.\n\n The Wishing Tree  is spreading its branches into endless night, countless candles flickering in the dim light.  Let me return to the circus.  You plead as you light another candle, feverishly hoping and praying your wish might come true \n\n\n\n\nArtist Credit: kemurai6 @ DeviantArt:\nShow more",

            "content": "I did not care for this book, which has sat on my all time favorites shelf for two years, AT ALL.\n\nhttps://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...\n\nThere s instalove, because of course. Characters are either a) horrendous or b) flat or c) somehow both??? Every other sentence is actually two forced together by a comma, because we all full-on adore a good comma splice amiright. Predicates suffer without subjects. The whole thing is so horrifically, tragically, life-bendingly slow and so boring it took me 9 days to suffer through it.\n\nHowever.\n\nThe setting is glorious, magical, awe-inspiring, creative, unreal, unique, fascinating, and altogether so painfully lovely any reader with half an imagination will be dying to pay a visit. DYING, I tell you.\n\nIt s better than Hogwarts. Better than any fantasy novel. It s life-changing and gorgeous and all around my favorite setting for all time forever.\n\nBUT.\n\nDon t forget.\n\nThis book is also really bad.\n\nSo how, pray tell, do I f*cking rate something like that? How do I review it???\n\nI guess I ll backtrack a little and cross my fingers for some fresh #inspo.\n\nThe Night Circus is a sprawling book (this is a nice way of saying it takes place over like a million years and is still somehow boring). We follow the creation of le Cirque des R ves, which is an entirely black and white circus with some delicious snack options that takes place at night. It arrives without warning, no announcement precedes it, etc etc, you ve heard the quote.\n\nSomething that should make this more interesting and instead makes it, in a shocking twist, much more boring, is that the circus is also the venue for a long-term magical battle.\n\nCelia and...sh*t what s his name...Marco? Is it Marco? Okay yes it s Marco. Celia and Marco are two magician people (illusionists) who are both involved in the circus and use it to one-up each other until eventually they get way too busy making sweet sweet love to even try to be interesting.\n\nIt s less hurtful because they were never interesting, really.\n\nSo that s the plot but I cannot emphasize enough that it does not matter, is really boring, and only serves to take away any number of pages from just describing the circus. Straight up if this was 600 pages of unbroken description...five stars boi.\n\nBut it s not. And here we are. Dealing with these cretins. (Marco, by the way, is the sh*ttiest person in the world and makes Boring But Otherwise Mildly Unpleasant Celia seem like a goddamn saint.)\n\nAs mentioned, the characters are, without exception, boring or bad or otherwise unpleasant. There was exactly one individual I liked, and said person was taken out of the picture faster than I can say  what the f*ck why do I never like any books I loved this book literally two years ago what is going onnnnn. \n\nAnd I can say that surprisingly quickly. (Because of practice. Because of all the times I ve said it.)\n\nGod I hate the name Marco on this dumbass white boi. Unrelated but I do.\n\nSpeaking of that warty wimp piece of sh*t, T H E I N S T A L O V E! If I have ever read a worse    love    story (love in excessive quotes because I m prettyyyyy sure you can t be in love with someone just because his eyes are such a lovely green!) I cannot recall it. Marco and Celia are nasty together. Not because they re cruel (although Marco is, to an innocent - albeit boring - woman), or because they re gross in the sense that, like, a witch in a live-action Disney movie is gross (although it inspires a similarly visceral disgust in me): because they are sooooo lovey-dovey and emotive. Right away. And also for all time forever with no relief.\n\nEnough o this.\n\nBottom line: instalove. Horrible characters. Terrible (nonexistent) plot. BUT ALSO THE BEST SETTING EVER WITH NO EXCEPTIONS.\n\nI don t know, man. You decide.\n\n\n------------------\n\n\ni did not like this book at all.\n\nalso, i loved it.\n\n(both of these things are equally true.)\n\nreview to come, once i get that sh*t sorted\n\n-----------\n\n\nme: *moves to college*\n\nme: *has literally no time, doesn't open laptop for 3 days, has had a total of 35 minutes to read*\n\nme: hmmm...i think it's time to pick up this 500-page, all-consuming fave of a book for a reread\n\nwish me luck in my bad decision making!!! you have to, condemning my horrible choices is mean!!!!!!\nShow more",

            "content": "Wedding cakes are typically the prettiest cakes, but they are almost never the tastiest cakes. I am not a cake expert (can I be one though? Is that a thing I can be?), but it seems to me that the tools necessary to make a cake exceptionally pretty -- a vat of fondant, to start -- also contribute to the cake not tasting all that good (unless you somehow really like fondant, which is incorrect).\n\nDon't misunderstand me, I have no issue with cake. The right decorations, the right frosting (buttercream, preferably chocolate), the right consistency (moist, but not crumbly), the right layering (chocolate mousse) -- it is a perfect example of a food that does one thing, but does it very well. And that's fine.\n\nBut a gorgeous wedding cake, covered in fondant and appliques, is only gorgeous until you cut into it, take a bit, and realize, hmmm. It's pretty and all, but you could do with a bit less artifice and a bit more of the good stuff. The cake part.\n\nThe Night Circus is a wedding cake with fondant that goes nearly all the way down. It is an -- captivating, intensely visual, ornate and delicately constructed, with unruly swirls of back and white and surprising splashes of vivid red. But what is underneath? Oh, there it is... a little bit of cake, way down at the bottom. It's pretty good, too. Light, airy, a hint of chocolate and smoke. But all that sculpted icing has lodged in your throat, and it's kind of hard to swallow.\n\nErin Morgenstern writes beautifully. This is a book about dueling magicians and bewitching enchantments, set in the Victorian age circus, so you can probably imagine what you're going to read, but she decorates her world remarkably well, creating magical attractions that are lightly sketched, allowing them to grow in your imagination (I want to play in the vertical cloud maze, and climb to the top and jump into a sea of wispy fluff).\n\nBut good lord, just re-read that paragraph. Magicians, Victorian circus, cloud maze, sea of fluff? Eye roll? I've read a few circus books, and I should probably get it into my head that they are almost never for me, because too much of this stuff can get to be a bit much. \"Insufferably twee,\" I might have commented. Did I mention is is also a star-cross'd romance? With achingly, dippily sincere lovers?\n\nI mean, whatever, that's fine. I can handle romance, I can handle reading long, elegant passages about the sets of various Tim Burton films. Just give me a good story.\n\nBut I don't think this book has a very good story. It is all setting, tone, establishing a mood. The story just kind of sits there, down at the bottom, under all that decoration. It isn't that interesting, and certainly not an entirely stable foundation. But maybe if it was jazzed up a bit? Put some filler in there -- a framing device, a needlessly fractured timeline. Does that make it taste better? Not really. The additional flavors are nice enough. They keep you reading, anyway (I can't remember if I am still talking about cake).\n\nNow for a paragraph that I won't be able to shoehorn into the strained theme of this review, but it needs to be said nonetheless: I don't like it when books about magic put zero parameters on what magic can do, or how it is. The magic in this book is unrestrained and excessive and after a while, very boring to read about. It powers the attractions at the Circus of Dreams, but with no restraints, the attractions can be, literally, anything. So why was I yawning halfway through the act?\n\nThis book has received intense advance hype, and it will probably be a huge seller. Probably. But I'm not sure. If I wanted to further stretch my metaphor I would point out that you buy cakes at Jewel all the time but you only buy a wedding cake once.\n\n--\n\nAddendum to Danielle Trussoni: I found your blurb on the back of this book to be as uninspiring as your . Do you really want to be the blurb-whore who speaks of a book that is explicitly about magic with phrases like \"so magical, there is no escaping its spell\"? Also, \"enchanting\"? Also, \"If you read just one novel this year, this is it\"? Really? As long as it isn't your book, I guess.\nShow more",

            "content": "I wavered between four and five stars on this one but then thought that I should show multi-millionaire authors the same generosity I show the struggling variety.\n\nThe Night Circus is very different from the kinds of fantasy books I ve been reading of late. It s not that it s written in the present tense (I read the excellent Master Assassins recently and that is also in present tense). It s not that is has a Victorian feel to it (the excellent Senlin Ascends has that). It s not that it s set in the real world (the highly enjoyable had a real world setting). It s that there are no deliberate killings. There is, dear reader, almost no violence at all.\n\nThis is in fact a gentle, magical book. A lot of time is spent describing delicate and beautiful enchantments and illusions. A lot of time is spent describing the courses at exotic dinners. There is a distinct interest in fashion, interior design, and the layout/decoration of the eponymous circus.\nIt s not a deeply philosophical book, or a deeply literary one (though there are allusions to Shakespeare) and it has a strong romantic element to it. So, very different from the kind of reads that I have been enjoying of late.\n\nAnd yet   and this is why I gave it 5*, I read the book in a handful of days, which rarely happens. So Morgenstern clearly worked her magic on me.\n\nI guess above all this is a work of imagination. There s an element of mystery, there s the romance, but the real star of the show is the circus itself and the finely described components, all of which bubble with imagination. The author succeeds in making you want to visit it, to experience its delights, to follow it across the world.\n\nThe story concerns two very powerful magicians who engage in a kind of proxy war via a series of prot g s who are pitted against each other pairwise. But the war is a war of ideas and the contest is a vaguely defined showcasing of talent.\n\nIt s not a story with any real tension, don t expect to find yourself biting your nails. There are no thrilling chases, fights, there s no real  baddy . Everyone is very civil all the way though. It s closer to Jane Austin than George Martin. But it is, as I ve said, gently enchanting and more-ish.\nCan I see why it has sold many millions of copies   no. Would I recommend it to you   yes. Oh wait. I guess that s  all  it takes to be a mega seller. If all your readers tell other readers to pick up the book, you have it made. Pick up the book.\n\nAs a side note: Years ago someone praising the prose sent me this line:\n\n\"Round spheres that resemble birdcages rise and descend while one or more aerialists move from within the sphere to without, standing on the top or hanging from the bars on the bottom.\"\n\nIt actually put me off. \"round spheres\" is redundant and I am picky.\n\nBut having read the book it turns out to be the only line I've any objection to!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n..\nShow more",

            "content": "Five Things About THE NIGHT CIRCUS.\n\nOrdinarily when I do my recommendations, I do a  five reasons to read _____,  but I think opinions will be so divided on THE NIGHT CIRCUS that I think  things about  will be more useful.\n\n1. This novel is not what it says it is. Well, back page copy is always a weird thing anyway, as it s not written by the author. And a weirder thing because it is essentially a glamour shot of the novel. It is not a lie. But it isn t really what the novel looks like when it s wandering around in its bathrobe getting coffee and trying to figure out if that smell is coming from the kitchen sink disposal or under the table. The resemblance is always a bit sketchy. THE NIGHT CIRCUS  resemblance to its cover copy is sketchier than most.\n\n2. This novel is about a thing. It has people in it, too, but it is mostly about a thing, the eponymous circus. It s told in third person omniscient, which means it sounds like God is narrating the thing, if God decided he really loved black and white tents and fancy umbrellas. The voice that narrates this book is interested in humans, too, but mostly about how humans make the circus and the circus  magic interesting.\n\n3. This is not a romance. There is a love story in it, which is good, because love makes the world go round, but it is not a romance. If you go in imagining to be swept off your feet from page one, you can keep on imagining. The novel starts before our lovebirds have hit puberty, so you re going to have to imagine for quite awhile.\n\n4. The circus is not really a circus. This is fine by me, because I actually don t care for circuses. They smell, the animals always have that look of dubious maltreatment, no, I don t want to win a prize by shooting that thing off that other thing over there, and also, clowns look a little grubby to me. No, the Night Circus is a circus in the respect that there are tents, and there are performers, and some of them are acrobats. Mostly it is a place where pretty, pretty magic is passed off as illusion so that us muggles won t be scared by it. I d go to that circus.\n\n5. This is not a thriller. This is a not an action-packed adventure. It s not even a simmering revenge or bubbling rivalry novel. It is a novel about a thing, with love in it, and it spans over a decade. If you have a problem with that idea, it s best you walk away now. But if you like Ann Patchett or Audrey Niffeneggar novels, or if you really thought JONATHAN STRANGE & MR. NORRELL was the bee s knees, well. WELL. You have just found your next read. Enjoy. I did.\nShow more",

I am not that reader. I prefer imagery to complement a plot rather than substitute it.\n\nThe plot summary of The Night Circus promised many enticing things, but delivered, in my opinion, only on one - lush imagery of a mysterious circus that was a collaborative creation of two rivaling magicians. The book was good 80% description of various circus tents, performances, dinners and pretty, visual acts of magic. I did enjoy it for the first 40 pages or so, but it got old very, very quickly. It got tiresome, it felt indulgent.\n\nThe remaining 20% were dedicated to: a battle between the two magicians that consisted of... making up pretty things to impress each other (yes, you read that right, no actual combating of any sorts in this \"fierce competition\") and a lukewarm romance that came out of the magicians' fascination with each other's creations from a distance, rather than interacting in any meaningful way.\n\nMy resulting disappointment with the novel had also a lot to do with the writing style - Morgenstern chose to write in present tense, 3rd person. It worked well for describing imagery, but made the narrative distant, detached and the characters - unrelatable and flat.\n\nTo be honest, I am not sure if can even make a decent movie (the rights were bought by Summit). There was not much drama there or action, the story was anti-climactic, the love was dull and the magic was only vaguely defined and seemed to have no rules and limitations.\n\nI am thoroughly puzzled by the book's comparisons to .\nShow more",

I'm reluctant to do that kind of review here and now because the experience of reading The Night Circus was like smelling a magnolia blossom...perfect, sweet, rich, satisfying a need I didn't know I had until it was met...but to examine it, to handle it, even gently, risks that somehow the magical smooth gorgeously textured vessel of chastely erotic pleasure that this book is will let it begin, inexorably and inevitably, to brown and curl and die, and become...just a wonderful book.\n\nI'm not ready for real life yet. I want the magic to linger just a little longer.\n\nThe physical book itself was a Christmas gift to me from a GoodReads friend, and to him I offer humble thanks on bended knee.

Everything else I read, from DH Lawrence to Hemingway to Dickens to Shakespeare (and this also included Dracula and Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde because they were \"true\" classics), was suggested and sanctioned by my mother (for which I will always owe her deeply).\n\nBut was mine and mine alone.\n\nIt is easy to forget that was not a pop culture phenomenon in the seventies and early eighties. It was a fringe book (at least in North America), something that was not yet considered a part of the canon, something that was not a name on every boy's lips (even if they were just getting to know D&D) let alone every child's lips. Sure it was respected and loved by those who knew it, but knowing it was not a foregone conclusion as it is today, and its audience was almost completely genre oriented. In my little community (my school and the blocks surrounding my home), I was the first kid to read it.\n\nAnd that first reading was a revelation. Sure I'd read , but that didn't prepare me for the breadth and depth of . Middle Earth in its grandest incarnation.\n\nTo create a fantasy world is one thing, but to breathe life into ages of that world, to keep all the pieces together with such magnificent detail and rigour, to create character after believable character and make us care about most of them, even poor Smeagol/Gollum, that is a literary labour of Hercules. And by pulling it off, created the single most important manifestation of Fantasy that has ever and will ever be written. has rightly been named a classic. It is part of the canon, and it deserves its place. It is entertaining, it is weighty, and it is loved by nearly all.\n\nAye...and there's the rub.\n\nIts indisputable greatness has made it .\n\nIt has become dogma among fanboys and fangirls that the bastions of are unassailable. Criticize Tolkien's work -- academically or otherwise -- and you put yourself in almost as much danger as a chatty atheist trying to engage in a theological discussion in a coliseum full of Jehovah's Witnesses (how many of those folks will make it into the afterlife? Isn't there a limit?).\n\nFeminist critics point out the lack of women in , and that those women who are present fulfill only the narrowest stereotypes.  owyn's strength is dependent upon adopting male gender qualities, a typical stereotype of \"powerful women in fantasy,\" and she is alone amongst the Rohirrim as a woman who can and will fight. All other women in her culture are present as a reason to fight rather than as integral parts of the struggle. Arwen's place (in the books, at least) as a maiden waiting for the hand of her king takes the \"reason to fight\" to even greater heights. And the only powerful female, Galadriel as the terrible, beautiful elven Queen, is too far removed from mortality and reality to be anything more than a mid-tale , thereby removing her from the realm of women and men and making her a pseudo-god whose power is allowed only because it is arcane and mysterious.\n\nPost-Colonial critics have latched onto the racism inherent in , pointing out the hierarchies between the races: from the \"superiority\" of the elves, to the \"chosen\" role of \"European\" Men of the West under the leadership of Aragorn, to the lesser races of Dwarves and Hobbits (the former are \"lesser\" because they are \"too greedy\" and the latter are \"lesser\" because they are children). Post-Colonialists look to the \"orientalization\" of Sauron's forces and the configuration of evil as an inherent quality of Orcs and \"the dark folk.\" They point out Tolkien's family's history as a cog in the mechanism of English Imperialism, and his own birth in one of the most blatantly racist colonies of all, South Africa (while he did leave at three years old, his family's presence there at all suggests that some of the classic colonial opinions about the colonized \"dark races\" helped form the man who wrote these books), as possible reasons for this racism.\n\nThese criticisms further suggest, at least to me, that the archetypal source of all fantasy's entrenched racism -- even those books being written today -- is . Those fantasy authors who have followed Tolkien consistently and inescapably embrace his configuration of the races (yes, even those like who try and fail to derail this configuration) and the concepts of good and evil that go along with them, which leads to the stagnation and diminishment of their genre.\n\nThe fact is that these flaws do exist in . They are present. They are easy to find. But few of Tolkien's rabid fans want to hear about them.\n\nAnd even when the criticism is not necessarily suggesting a flaw in Tolkien's work but merely the presence of some subtext, the dogmatists react with rage and condemnation. A fine example of this is when Queer and Gender theorists point to the overwhelming relationships between men, and how the relationship between Frodo and Sam is homosocial, at least, and possibly even homosexual. The only true intimacy in the book occurs between the men, after all, and to ignore that fact is to ignore one of key components of why is so emotionally satisfying, especially to young men.\n\nEven faced with these ideas supported by convincing arguments, however, many fans either strive for ignorance or attack the messenger. This may have much to do with the worry -- unreasonable though it is -- that to admit that a flaw or something uncomfortable exists in any of these books, which so many people love so deeply, is to accept that is neither great nor worthy of love.\n\nBut this is not the case.\n\nI love even though I subscribe completely to the post-colonial criticism, and see the merits in both the feminine and queer criticisms, not to mention the countless other criticisms and subtexts that are floating around.\n\nThe books racist; they sexist. They perfect. And I must criticize the elements of that make me uncomfortable and deserve no praise. But my complaints and the complaints of critics make 's achievement no less great.\n\nTolkien created the most magnificent imaginary world ever conceived, and, for good or ill, Fantasy would be nothing today were it not for him. is a triumph on countless levels, but it is not the word of God, nor should it be elevated to such heights.\n\nI love , but I love it with reservations. I love it because of its place in my personal mythology, its genuine originality, its creativity, its power, but I love it with my mind open to its flaws, and I refuse to make excuses for Tolkien or his work.\n\nTwenty-five years ago I'd have given my highest possible praise. Not today. But I am still willing to admit my love.\nShow more",

            "content": "Considering that The Lord of the Rings is one of the most popular books of the last century, it's surprising to see how few reviews there are here. I get the impression that many people feel guilty about liking it. It's a phase you go through, and the less said about it, the better. I think this is unfair to the book, which, I am prepared to argue, is a whole lot better than it's generally made out to be; I don't think its huge success is just evidence that people have no taste. It's something that can be read at more than one level, and, before dismissing it, let's take a look at what those levels might be.\n\nOn the surface, it's a heroic fantasy novel, and quite a good one. It's a gripping, well-realized story, with an interesting fantasy world as background. Under the surface story, it's also clear that there's a moral discourse. It's not an allegory; as Tolkien points out in the foreword, he hated allegory, and we certainly don't have an in-your-face piece of Christian apology by numbers. None the less, the author has constructed some inspiring and thought-provoking symbols. The Ring confers great power, but the only way to defeat Sauron is to refuse that power, and destroy it, even at great personal cost. Frodo's self-sacrifice is quite moving. I also think that Gandalf is an unusually interesting Christ-figure; sufficiently so that many people refuse even to accept him as one, though, at least to me, the argument on that point seems convincing. He comes from Valinor, obviously the Heavenly Realm, to help the Free Peoples of the West. A central part of his message is the importance of mercy, as, in particular, shown by the memorable scene near the beginning, when he rebukes Frodo for wishing that Bilbo had killed Sm agol when he had the opportunity. As we discover, Sm agol is finally the one person who can destroy the Ring. And let's not miss the obvious point that Gandalf is killed, and then returns reborn in a new shape. I find him vastly more sympathetic than C.S. Lewis's bland Aslan, and he is the book's most memorable character.\n\nBut I don't think the morality play is the real kernel either. What makes LOTR a unique book, and one of the most ambitious experiments in literary history, is Tolkien's use of names. All authors knows how important names are, and use them to suggest character; though when you think about what is going on, it is rather surprising how much can be conveyed just by a name. Proust has a couple of long discussions about this, describing in great detail how the narrator's initial mental pictures of Balbec, Venice and the Guermantes family come just from the sounds of their names. Tolkien goes much further. Most of his names are based on a family of invented languages, linked by a vast complex of legends and histories, the greater part of which are invisible to the reader and only surface occasionally.\n\nThe astonishing thing is that the technique actually works. The interrelations between all the invented names and languages make Middle-Earth feel real, in a way no other fantasy world ever has. When some readers complain that characters and locations are hastily sketched, I feel they are missing the point. Tolkien was a philologist. He loved languages, words and names, and tracing back what the relationships between them say about their history. In LOTR, he's able to convey some of that love of language to his readers. You have to read the book more than once, but after a while it all comes together. To give just a few obvious examples, you see how \"hobbit\" is a debased form of the word (\"hole-dweller\") in the Old Norse-like language of Rohan, how the \"mor\" in \"Moria\" is the same as the one in \"Mordor\" and \"morgul\", and how Arwen Und miel's name expresses her unearthly beauty partly through the element it shares with her ancestor L thien Tin viel. There are literally hundred more things like this, most of which one perceives on a partly unconscious level. The adolescent readers who are typically captivated by LOTR are at a stage of their linguistic development when they are very sensitive to nuances of language, and programmed to pick them up; I can't help thinking that they are intuitively seeing things that more sophisticated readers may miss.\n\nPerhaps the simplest way to demonstrate the magnitude of Tolkien's achievement is the fact that it's proven impossible to copy it; none of the other fantasy novels I've seen have come anywhere close. Tolkein's names lend reality to his world, because he put so much energy into the linguistic back-story, and before that worked for decades as a philologist. Basically, he was an extremely talented person who spent his whole life training to write . In principle, I suppose other authors could have done the same thing. In practice, you have to be a very unusual person to want to live that kind of life.\n\nWriting this down reminds me of one of the Sufi stories in . The guy is invited to a posh house, and sees this incredibly beautiful, smooth lawn. It's like a billiard table. \"I love your lawn!\" he says. \"What's the secret?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" his host says, \"It's easy. Just seed, water, mow and roll regularly, and anyone can do it!\"\n\n\"Ah yes!\" says the visitor, \"And about how long before it looks like that?\"\n\n\"Hm, I don't know,\" says the host. \"Maybe... 800 years?\"\nShow more",

            "content": "The total ringasm united\n\nAll reviews of the whole series combined for your convenience and to help me lazy procrastinator create another review copy and paste style\n\nThe fellowship of the ring\n\nFounding a genre like a boss\n\nStealing everything possible from mythology and the, maybe sometimes a tiny bit boring, old, classics.\nThe beloved tradition of using others' ideas to create something new is big here, especially because Tolkien had the perfect background to milk everything from wherever he could find inspirations, from ancient to medieval and, at the time, modern works. It would especially be interesting to read or reread LotR with a focus on how he let the classics mutate to new forms, transformed oldfashioned tropes to fit for a modern audience, and especially made it a compelling, well written, and suspenseful pageturner. Don t be angry, good old classics, it s not your fault, your poor creators just had no creative writing courses available or were hunted by the inquisition, or it were total monopolies to that their works were the only ones available, and thereby never cared about royalties, book signing tours, or target audiences.\n\nBlack, white, and the most important grey\nThe pure, camouflages fascistic, evil, is of course as noir as possible, but especially the sexy seductiveness of the mind penetrating psi magic of the distilled badassery, is one of the main driving engines of the groundbreaking epic journey, because good old almightiness totally corrupts. It s just normal that everyone is struggling with the whispering of the dark side with all its attractive options and the real life implications of this are, well, terrible, frustrating, and daunting. Throw money at close to everyone and she/he will get corrupted, especially if the alternative is to get eaten by orcs while the family is raped by Uruk hais and Balrogs.\n\nEstablishing cliffhangery ends of single parts\nOne just can t stop, this damn, evil tendency of the genre to stop at the most suspenseful part and let the reader hanging to wait for felt eternities. As if Sauron wasn t bad enough, this vicious cycle continues with each new, far too multi k page series and eats away the lives of poor, innocent humans, not to speak of their tormented souls that can t find peace over these nauseating periods of despair and regret to have been relapsing. Again! I m not sure if Tolkien should be praised or damned for having laid the foundations for things like Sandersons , Jordans , Eriksons , etc. amazingly exhausting and immersive monster series. I m ashamed to admit it, but I have the whole, good old second hand paperback, Wheel of time series  (and the new ones) lying around and I am afraid to restart reading the whole thing (not just the first few parts like a few years ago), because I fear that it could trigger reading and rereading other series and finally Wheel of time again until 2027 or something, not just having lost contact to reality (not much difference to the present reality\n), but, much more problematic, to all other genres for half a decade or something. Thanks for that, J.R.R!\n\nBeing attacked by the bigoted academic society of the time\nThat s just ridiculous, Tolkien had to hide and vindicate his amazing work, because it wasn t highbrow enough for his snobbish, elitist, and old, boring, so called quality literature prone, colleagues and a bigoted, conservative society that wasn t ready for something new. Better stay with theater texts as books or whatever can be used for patriotic  our writer  idiocy. Just bad luck that there aren t enough good, if any, old writers for each country to fuel feelings of literary supremacy. However, it s one more of these examples of how parochial even seemingly well educated and sophisticated people can be as soon as it comes to close to their cognitive dissonances and socioeconomic status hierarchy overkill.\n\nPutting in meta, connotations, and social criticism\nTolkien was heavily influenced and inspired by war, and the atrocities humans so much love to do to each other until nasty nukes eliminated the option of more WW action, and put the real life implications everywhere in his work. Not just in the form of the big, bad government cooperating with war industry, propaganda machines, and black magic, but with\n\nCorrupted blood\nThe banality of evil, the attractiveness of the dark side is, as mentioned in  Black, white, and   above, is one of the driving forces of the saga and without Tolkiens experiences, it might have stayed much more superficial and have never reached that deep level of human soul and psyche vivisection. The same with love, without his lifelong, deep bound to this adored wife, he wasn t allowed to see until reaching full age, the importance of emotions maybe wouldn t have unfolded and played such an essential role in the work. Expanding this whole, philosophical, psychological somewhat assumptions to his profession as a philologist and, for the standards of the time, mad professor, would go a bit too far, but let s just say that his expertise might have helped him create both Silmarillion and Lord of the Rings.\n\nIs it outdated?\nVery objective thing, even if not including the sociocultural, immense literary impact, Tolkien invested a bit more than the usual fantasy writer in her/his third or fourth series with a new one each new year. Just take the mentioned Silmarillion, the immense details of the world, all the links to the cultural heritage, and the sheer scale and size, and, on top of that, close to everyone agrees that it s a timeless, genre founding, ingenious masterpiece that will stand the test of not just time, but eternity. Sure, it s not as accessible as the average, new, overhyped world bestseller, but that s the same as with Lem, Lovecraft, etc., authors just were used to write in that wacky, overcomplicated, intricate, and difficult to digest language, because they were no narcissistic, lazy, self aggrandizing, god complexed hedonists. I won t excuse for that, I m one myself and have N word privileges.\n\n\nComparing and contrasting fantasy with other genres\nHorror, Sci-Fi, or crime had no similar big bangs (fringe theory, by the way, to provoke and insult even more additional people than with just the human degeneration gag above lol) but different founders, prodigies, and subgenres, while fantasy was, stayed, and will be very genre compliant, not to say a bit inflexible in contrast to other genres with much vaster differences, especially sci fi, my bread and peanut butter. So one could say that close to every, no matter if grimdark, YA, high, epic, romantic, etc. fantasy, is always quite the same with some variations of magic systems, the balance of focus on protagonists or antagonists, tone, and the rare establishment of the one or other sub sub genre.\n\nThe endless evolution\nClose to all human mythology, faith, myths, etc. is fantasy and I see one of its biggest potentials in a fusion to science fantasy, because it opens up all options including any horror or psychothriller crime plot. Without Tolkien, this amazing development couldn t have taken place\nso soon and it would have probably needed much longer to establish the (I m a sci-fi head, sorry) second best genre to subjugate and enslave them all.\n\n\n\nBromancing to Mordor while Middle Earth falls to pieces\n\nSplit personality overkill\nGolluming through life is a hard task, especially if it s that freaking long. Too many different psychological, sociological, etc implications to name them all, but poor Smeagols' quest towards looking freaking emo zombie style could easily be seen as the decision between happiness and sadness, the seductive potential of power, or simply the easygoing simplicity of evil. It could also be seen as the perverting energy of power, with the good old saying that total perversion totally corrupts, that good people get nasty as soon as they get money, influence, or a fancy invisible mindpenetrating bling bling, that would also be a fantastic bluetooth fingerset to always stay in touch with your evil overlord.\n\nPlanning and preparation is everything\nAfter everything has been established in the first part, the whole scenery can lift off, get far darker and hopeless, introduce new friends, foes, and people not sure which to choose, and in general create the outline for the genre itself. I assume that the mysticism, nerdgasms, and glorification around Tolkiens  work and its immense impact make it (subjectively for me too, not even mentioning the nostalgic touch) one of the most fertile cornerstones of the maybe biggest popular fictional genre.\n\nnew brand of evil with a touch of  bersoldier breeding program\nAnother milestone,\nleads to even more suspense and includes the always and forever important rule of warfare of pimping ones  killer machines to let them Chuck the heck out of every enemy. At least until automatization and robotization of warfare sets in and lets each soft bloodbag fall into pieces miles away from the unbeatable killer machines. Except the fantasy fractions have magic and mind controlling psi-powers. However, this dynamic leads to an even more suspenseful and action loaded plot than just one evil fraction united in darkening the world forever.\n\nA full picture of the world.\nNow the reader can enjoy so many different settings, cultures, traditions, and even a bit of political power balance, that it feels kind of relaxing to switch to Sam and Frodo from time to time for some good, old fight for survival without complicated following the big picture actions.\nIt may be appropriate to read the Silmarillion too to get even more out of this. It s as difficult to read as the classics that inspired Tolkien and that were adapted by him, but directly linked to the backstory and history of the actions, so maybe the better and not as dry alternative. Still just something for the really hardcore fangirl/boy enthusiasts out there.\n\nNo banality of evil\nNearly all antagonists have no grey areas, no moral dilemmas, no option to change towards the better, and that may be one of the biggest differences in contrast to modern fantasy, where these eclectic evildoers often have backstory, tragedy, depth, etc. explaining what made them the creatures they are. Not giving excuses for what they do, but making them feel more human/inhuman if they re fantasy creatures (bad wordplay), and their actions comprehensible and not just evil. In the good old times, it was clear which was the team to promote, but meanwhile, it has become a tricky, ethical dilemma with far too many implications, innuendos, and stuff.\n\nPreparing for the endfight\nAs in many great series, everything is interconnected and the whole thing accelerates towards a great cliffhanger, letting one ask what might both meta and personally happen to all those freaking fascinating fantasy fighters. Classy   buy the next part to know how it will go on  dynamic, something that has stolen estimated hundreds of millions of days of lifetime of poor, addicted, fantasy readers.\nMust read the Wheel of time series .\nThanks for that, JRR!\n\nEstablishing fantasy supertropes\nNa matter if it are the fractions, superhuman elves, monster orcs, grumpy dwarfs, wise wizards, brave halflings, etc, the heroes journey, the switching between fast and slow pace, the cuts between meta fights, battles and the preparation of these and the personal, emotional scenes and the big, epic scenes including all characters, Tolkien defined the genre in a way maybe nobody else may ever have the influence to do. He not just inspired so many great fantasy authors, but indirectly helped creating so many sub-genres that are more and more expanding to subsubs, and I can remember hearing rumors about something like a subsubsub somewhere in the regions of dark science fantasy, but I don t really trust the alien succubus who whispered it in my ear and assume that it was just a cheap trick to get me laid where she wanted me to go for a quest. But not again, honey!\n\n\n\nI ll just wear the ring one more, last, short time, and then really go to rehab\n\nLetting the established storylines collide in an epic culmination\nThat s what most fantasy, no matter if high, science, or dark, series keep doing, no matter if it are 3, 5, or 10 parts. Tolkien accelerates the story engine towards an end that has already been prepared and enabled in the first 2 parts of the series, letting it feel like one, big piece. Another genre milestone that escalates to ridiculous lengths and perfection in many fantasy series and makes them so addictive.\n\nThe big longtime impact is uncomparable to other genres\nOf course, sci fi and horror have their prodigies and milestones too, but they can go and splitter in many different subgenres, focus on psychological elements with characterization, or just epic battle and splatter, but fantasy is extremely genre standard focused regarding what to deliver and hasn t that much room for experiments, kind of traditional in what it should deliver. And Tolkien set the standards for it, showed how to do it, and helped to inspire the production of dozens of great series, hundreds of average ones, and an innumerable amount of fanfiction. Of course, his inspiration came from the millennia of storytelling that formed the works he took for his reinterpretations, so any aspiring fantasy author could see her/himself as an ancestor of a tradition to not just pass the stories themselves. But the much more important part, the ability to tell them, to use tropes and creative writing to hypnotize readers and eat away their lifetime with multi k behemoths of fantasy series.\n\nBromance gets tragic\nThe, some may say a bit too intense gaytrix style, Frodo Sam relationships gets tragic, because as so often with substance abuse, both body and soul get ruined by it and the ones who suffer are family and friends. One could go one more meta step and say that it s not just addiction, but ideological contamination too, that extremism and faith poison the minds of normally friendly people who carry their toxicity home and make living together hell. Because, all in all, it s\n\nFascism crushed by united, different fractions that understand that they re just powerful together as one population of Middle earth, no matter how small and hairy or angular eared they may be.\nAnother heavy one, the ending can be seen in many different ways, from just a megalomaniac battle overkill to the deeper meanings of the journeys that make the victory of the good ones possible. Or that everyday people don t understand the power they could have if they would work together against a dictatorship, economic inequality, and grievances. Or that the evil is still lurking in everyone and that it takes a permanent struggle to keep the peace by controlling the inner demons. Endless interpretations until eternity beyond the straight road to Aman.\n\nTropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique:\nShow more",

Along the way, Frodo travels with various characters, and they find themselves constantly in peril.\n\nThis book was very challenging for a variety of reasons. It has a completely different world with completely new beings (hobbits, etc.) while the book flows as if you know all about these creatures. Additionally, it was so different from reality that it was difficult to visualize. This was one of the rare instances where I feel that the movie was better than the book. The quest is extremely long, and it kept reiterating the fact that they are taking on a quest that might not be successful. Although it served as a good reminder to really challenge oneself, it was very repetitive, and my patience was wearing thin in a 1,000+ page book. It also was extremely slow going in places (more than 100 pages just to leave to go on the adventure). Personally, I felt that it was such a chore to read this book, and it derailed my entire reading plan for 2020. The Hobbit was much shorter and straight to the point.\n\nThat being said, Tolkien created entire worlds. That creativity has laid the foundation for so many other authors and stories. This book has inspired people to dream dreams. It just didn't inspire me. However, I feel that I would be remiss if I didn't note that the impact this book has had in the world and on arts/literature even in the present year. I could reread a page or two, but I would not want to read this book again.\n\nThe ending....after 1,000+ pages, it seemed very abrupt. And I was left thinking, \"Um why didn't they just do that in the beginning to destroy the ring?!\"\n\n\nShow more",

So instead I ve picked one element of each book that I liked the most (taken from my list of ten on each review) and added them here. It s the best I can do, though I know many goodreads users share my difficulty when reviewing this book.\n\nAnyway, here s my top three:\n\n-\n\nNot all the party have been fully tested. With them travel four young hobbits, the most unlikely of companions for such a journey. They are the overlooked, the forgotten about, the race that is casually discarded and considered insignificant in the wider world. And perhaps this has been the downfall of society in middle earth previously. The forces of darkness exploit everything they can get their hands on, from giant spiders to rampaging trolls, from dragons to orcs, from men of the east to the undead, Sauron tries to wield it all. This is something the forces of good have not fully considered until recently. Within the bosom of the hobbit beats a strong heart of fortitude and resilience.\n\n\n\nThey carry with them the key to destroying the dark. Bilbo showed them how he could resist the ring. The hobbits are an incorruptible race, and because of this they are Sauron s doom. It is something he has overlooked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\nGandalf the Grey was charming and quirky; he was everybody s friend and advisor. But he was also a great wonderer and a great quester. He was an unearther of dark secrets and mysteries. And Middle-Earth no longer needs such a figure, darkness is now on her doorstep; it is no longer hidden. So Middle-Earth needs a man (or Istari) with far sight that can unite the scattered forces of Rohan and manipulate events in order to ensure that the King does, indeed, return. It needs a methodical man of great wisdom and intelligence; it needs a stagiest: it needs a new white wizard now that Saruman has changed his colours. And he has come.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere have not been many moments for women to show their strength in this story. Arwen s moment in the films was non-existent in the book. Frodo was saved on the river by an Elf-lord called Glorfindel. So when Eowen battled the Witch King, it is the first major moment Tolkien gave to a female hero. In a vastly male dominated genre, it was great to read this scene. If I have one criticism of Tolkien, it s that we didn t see more of such things.\n\n\n\nAnd here's a gif I like:\n\nShow more",

            "content": "(Book 494 From 1001 Books) - The Lord of The Rings (The Lord of the Rings #1-3), J.R.R. (John Ronald Reuel) Tolkien\n\nThe Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by English author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien.\n\nThe story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work.\n\nWritten in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling novels ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.\n\nThe title of the novel refers to the story's main antagonist, the Dark Lord Sauron, who had in an earlier age created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power as the ultimate weapon in his campaign to conquer and rule all of Middle-earth. (Nineteen of these rings were made. These were grouped into three rings for the Elves, seven rings for the Dwarves, and nine rings for men. One additional ring, the One Ring, was forged by Sauron himself at Mount Doom.).\n\nFrom quiet beginnings in the Shire, a hobbit land not unlike the English countryside, the story ranges across Middle-earth, following the course of the War of the Ring through the eyes of its characters, not only the hobbits Frodo Baggins, Samwise \"Sam\" Gamgee, Meriadoc \"Merry\" Brandybuck and Peregrin \"Pippin\" Took, but also the hobbits' chief allies and travelling companions: the Men, Aragorn son of Arathorn, a Ranger of the North, and Boromir, a Captain of Gondor; Gimli son of Gl in, a Dwarf warrior; Legolas Greenleaf, an Elven prince; and Gandalf, a wizard. ....\n\n                         :                                                                                                       :   .  .

            "content": "One of the greatest trilogies of all time and certainly the measuring stick to which all subsequent fantasy-style writing is compared, The Lord of the Rings trilogy still stands at the top of the stack. Its realism, the characters and monsters, the storyline, the epic battles, and the quest motif are all drawn with incredible care by Tolkien in his chef-d'oeuvre. My favorite was The The Two Towers but all three are stunning. This edition, despite the awful cover art, contains all three books and the original appendices from The Return of the King. The one issue I have with this one is that the map of Middle Earth that should open is back in the appendices and relatively hard to find. It is also a rather large book and thus unwieldy for public transport commuting.\n\nI wanted to use this review to address a few overall themes of LOTR: symbolism, ecology, sexuality.\n\n\nAs for symbolism, as described in , Tolkien's politics are not mapped onto the characters of Middle Earth in any obvious way. The symbols he uses go back before the Germanic invasions of Britain around 1000 because his goal is precisely to recreate the mythology that existed in England, Scotland and Wales before this period of instability and wanton destruction. His theory was that there were shards of that previous system of beliefs, fears, mythologies that survived in story form in the Arthurian tales, in Beowolf, in Gawain, and other Old English remnants. Most of the transmission was done orally, so when that generation disappeared after Norman invasions of the 11c (1066 - Battle of Hastings) for the most part, collective memory subsumed some of these images. Tolkien's idea was to extract these and try to revive the uber-myths that they derived from. He was a philologue, meaning that he studies in-depth the origins of the English language and chaired the Philology Department at Oxford for decades. Old English and its offspring Middle English owed their origins to various Nordic tongues (Old Norse, Old Icelandic) and eventually, the invading Norsemen brought their culture and religion and especially their languate ultimately fusing all of these into what became the Modern English that I am writing in now. In fact, Tolkien's translation of Beowolf is still a reference for scholars of Old English even today. All that to say that in reading the oldest extant myths in the \"Old\" languages, Tolkien got a sense that there was something important that was hidden just beneath the surface, and he spent nearly his entire life as a linguistic speleologue trying to find it - sort of a human Dorin mining Moria to find the original stories. The Elves represent the very first humanoids to arrive in England whereas the Dwarves represent the various invasions from Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Iceland before 1000. Men are those who populated the Middle Ages and Hobbits are sort of the archetype of the middle-class, landed but non-aristocratic gentry in the villages of England.\n\nPerhaps the one place where political events in Tolkien's own life affect the narrative is in the episode at the very end of The Scouring of the Shire. Here we see History catch up with the Idyllic and somewhat isolated Shire where violence (the sad, pathetic revenge of Saruman on Bilbo and Frodo for having thwarted his plans) rages across the land, nature is destroyed, and industrialization arises. This represents the Industrial Revolution but also the coming of age for Tolkien himself in WWI and, I would argue, the bombing of Oxford during the Battle of Britain during WWII that he experienced first-hand as well. It is interesting that this is included as a coda after the main action of the epic is already concluded, as if he had this one other thing to say before sending Gandalf, Frodo and Bilbo off to Grey Haven with the Elves, thus definitively ending the pre-Modern Middle Earth (and by extension Medieval and Revolutionary Europe) and entering into the Modern/Industrial Age.\n\n\nI wrote quite a lot about Tolkien's sensibility to nature in my previous LOTR reviews (see below), but I wanted to reiterate that in these books, nature itself is a character in the saga. When Tolkien talks about flowers or herbs, his descriptions are lush in detail and even anthropomorphic as it comes to trees (Ents for example). Indeed, recalling what I said above about his pining for an England before the agricultural and industrial revolutions when the great primitive forests still covered England and all of Europe, he bemoans the loss of this environment time and time again. Most poignantly, I think, with Treebeard's sad resignation at the definitive disappearance of Entmaidens which spells certain death for his species. Sam is able to bear the destruction of Hobbiton to a degree, but when he sees the Party Tree under which Bilbo gave his Farewell Speech destroyed and lying dead on the ground, something breaks inside of him.\n\nNature in LOTR is a living, breathing thing and critical to the success of the mission: without the Ents, the Battle of Isengard would certainly have not been such a definitive defeat for Sarumon (another reason why he attacked not only Hobbits but trees as well in his Scouring of the Shire). The loss of communication between Man and Forest is one of the reasons for the breakdown in relationships between Rohan and Gondor as well as that between Elves and Men, thus the marriages of Faramir and Eowyn and Aragorn and Arwen are so important for reforging those bonds and replanting the forests that were impacted by the war. Once communication has been reestablished and the forests resume their role in connecting communities, peace can once again attempt to thrive.\n\nLastly, I would point out that this sense of the importance of ecology has completely disappeared from fantasy (and its modern derivation of dystopias) literature (at least as far as I have read). The stories of Harry Potter, Hunger Games, the Grishaverse, and so on have pushed trees and nature into a Hollywood backdrop for the most part. This is rather unfortunate because that means that the generations after LOTR did not really have a solid basis of awareness about man's intimate connection to nature making it easier to deny the grim reality of climate change and ecological destruction since it is seen as superficially unrelated to their daily lives. Fortunately, the tide seems to be turning as evidenced by the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction given to Richard Ford's excellent .\n\n\nThe last theme I wanted to touch on briefly was sexuality. For the most part, the world of Middle Earth is asexual. The relationships between the paired characters, say, Sam and Frodo and Legolas and Gimli, are those of deep, intimate but strictly non-sexual friendships. In the case of Sam and Frodo, I suppose that it could be argued that Sam sometimes has a man-crush on Frodo, but it is not truly reciprocated nor acted on other than their relationship involving more hugs and handholding than other friendships in the book.\n\nAs for the Elves, we have several gorgeous women Elves: Arwen and Galadriel, but both are asexual (at least until Arwen weds Aragorn) despite provoking deep reverence in Merry, it remains platonic and more of a one-sided infatuation. There is little mention of rape in LOTR even during the war, this book having originally being intended as a sequel to the child-focused , perhaps that plus the natural British tendency to whitewash unsightly behavior was at play.\n\nFor the most part, women play a secondary or tertiary role in LOTR. At one point, Galadriel could become a supremely powerful figure, but she renounces it in after looking into her Mirror and seeing the consequences. The notable exception to this is, of course, Eowyn who revendicates her status of independence from her 'cage' and who slays the King of the Nazg l in revenge of the death of her father and both protecting Merry and saving the outcome of the battle for the good guys with her immortal: \"For no man am I!\" speech. That being said, she is obliged to give up her love for Aragorn and settle for Faramir, who fortunately has a good heart and seems to truly love her at first sight. What I am getting at is that Eowyn escapes her fate as a non-actor in history with her act in the battlefield, but does not escape her destiny becoming a wife to a man at the end. Perhaps in that sense, Galadriel does remain a heroic figure, if more passive than Eowyn, she retains her total independence and a modicum of power, being one of the last two Ring holders with Gandalf.\n\nGandalf's lack of sexuality is interesting. Perhaps folks were put off by the adage that one must never delve into the affairs of wizards because they are of short and violent humor. In any case, he is clearly not homosexual (unlike his distant cousin Dumbledore according to Rowling ()). He is more an archetype of the Catholic God the Father than the sex-hound Jove.\n\n\nWell, I hope you appreciated these thoughts about LOTR and that it will encourage you to reread this classic and be more environmentally-aware going forward. Long live Middle Earth!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more",

I tried to read this part of the book once, but DNF it then. Then I picked up the trilogy bound in one volume and went through it fairly steadily.\n\nI've read that Tolkien wasn't as original as first claimed. There is a book called The Broken Sword that has parallels with LotR. Nevertheless Tolkien take on traditional myths was unique and groundbreaking. The Eddas, the Welsh myths, and Norse myths all are the foundation for this great story.\n\nThis was a reread and was a satisfactory one because I wanted to reach my favorite parts. I looked forward to read Tom Bombadil's part again. Did it. Then the Rivendell parts, ditto. Slowly I wound my way, sometimes following Sam and Frodo, sometimes Aragorn. Gandalf appears relatively scantily towards the third book. I had a lot of fun reading LoTR, and I've not yet deleted it from my Ereader because I'm tempted to reread it soon.

            "content": "Authors who inspire a movement are usually misunderstood, especially by those they have inspired, and Tolkien is no exception, but one of the biggest misconceptions about Tolkien is the idea that he is somehow an 'innovator of fantasy'. He did add a number of techniques to the repertoire of epic fantasy writers, and these have been dutifully followed by his many imitators, but for the most part, these techniques are little more than bad habits.\n\nMany have called Tolkien by such epithets as 'The Father of Fantasy', but anyone who makes this claim simply does not know of the depth and history of the fantasy genre. For those who are familiar with the great and influential fantastical authors, from and to and to and , it is clear that, long before Tolkien, fantasy was already a complex, well-established, and even a respected literary genre.\n\ncontains an invented world, a carefully-constructed (and well-researched) archaic language, a powerful and unearthly queen, and a central character who is conflicted and lost between the forces of nobility and darkness. Poul Anderson's , which came out the same year as The Fellowship of the Ring, has distant, haughty elves, deep-delving dwarves, a broken sword which must be reforged, an epic war between the armies of light and darkness, another central character trapped between those extremes, and an interweaving of Christian and Pagan worldviews.\n\nSo, if these aspects are not unique to Tolkien, then what does set him apart? Though Dunsany, Eddison, and Anderson all present worlds where light and dark come into conflict, they present these conflicts with a subtle and often ironic touch, recognizing that morality is a dangerous thing to present in absolutes. Tolkien (or ), on the other hand, has no problem in depicting evil as evil, good as good, and the only place they meet is in the temptation of an honest heart, as in Gollum's case--and even then, he is not like Eddison's Lord Gro or Anderson's Scafloc, characters who live under an alternative view of the world, but instead fluctuates between the highs and lows of Tolkien's dualistic morality.\n\nIt is a dangerous message to make evil an external, irrational thing, to define it as 'the unknown that opposes us', because it invites the reader to overlay their own morality upon the world, which is precisely what most modern fantasy authors tend to do, following Tolkien's example. Whether it's or John Norman's , its very easy to simply create a magical allegory to make one side 'right' and the other side 'wrong', and you never have to develop a dramatic narrative that actually explores the soundness of those ideas. Make the good guys dress in bright robes or silvery maile and the bad guys in black, spiky armor, and a lot of people will never notice that all the 'good guys' are White, upper class men, while all the 'bad guys' are 'brutish foreigners', and that both sides are killing each other and trying to rule their little corner of the world.\n\nIn Tolkien's case, his moral view was a very specific evocation of the ideal of , which is an attempt by certain stodgy old Tories (like Tolkien) to rewrite history so that the nobility were all good and righteous leaders, the farmers were all happy in their 'proper place' (working a simple patch of dirt), while both industrialized cultures and the 'primitives' who resided to the South and East were 'the enemy' bent on despoiling the 'natural beauty of England' (despite the fact that the isles had been flattened, deforested, and partitioned a thousand years before).\n\nThough Tom Bombadil remains as a strangely incoherent reminder of the moral and social complexity of the fantasy tradition upon which Tolkien draws, he did his best to scrub the rest clean, spending years of his life more wholly into his Pagan adventure realm. But then, that's often how we think of Tolkien: bent over his desk, spending long hours researching, note-taking, compiling, and playing with language. Even those who admit that Tolkien demonstrates certain racist, sexist, and classicist leanings (as, indeed, do many great authors) still praise the complexity of his 'world building'.\n\nAnd any student of the great Epics, like the Norse Eddas, the Bible, or the Shahnameh can see what Tolkien is trying to achieve with his worldbuilding: those books presented grand stories, but were also about depicting a vast world of philosophy, history, myth, geography, morality and culture. They were encyclopedic texts, intended to instruct their people on everything important in life, and they are extraordinarily valuable to students of anthropology and history, because even the smallest detail can reveal something about the world which the book describes.\n\nSo, Tolkien fills his books with troop movements, dull songs, lines of lineage, and references to his own made-up history, mythology, and language. He has numerous briefly-mentioned side characters and events because organic texts like the epics, which were formed slowly, over time and compiled from many sources often contained such digressions. He creates characters who have similar names--which is normally a stupid thing to do, as an author, because it is so confusing--but he s trying to represent a hereditary tradition of prefixes and suffixes and shared names, which many great families of history had. So Tolkien certainly had a purpose in what he did, but was it a purpose that served the story he was trying to tell?\n\nSimply copying the form of reality is . Art is meaningful--it is directed. It is not just a list of details--everything within is carefully chosen by the author to make up a good story. The addition of detail is not the same as adding depth, especially since Tolkien s world is not based on some outside system--it is whatever he says it is. It s all arbitrary, which is why the only thing that grants a character, scene, or detail purpose is the meaning behind it. Without that meaning, then what Tolkien is doing is just a very elaborate thought exercise. Now, it s certainly true that many people have been with studying it, but that s equally true of many thought exercises, such as the rules and background of the Pokemon card game, or crossword puzzles.\n\nOstensibly, Scrabble supposedly is a game for people who love words--and yet, top Scrabble players sit an memorize lists of words whose meaning they will never learn. Likewise, many literary fandom games become little more than word searches: find this reference, connect that name to this character--but which have no meaning or purpose outside of that. The point of literary criticism is always to lead us back to human thought and ideas, to looking at how we think and express ourselves. If a detail in a work cannot lead us back to ourselves, then it is no more than an arbitrary piece of chaff.\n\nThe popularity of Tolkien s work made it acceptable for other authors to do the same thing, to the point that whenever I hear a book lauded for the  depth of its world building , I expect to find a mess of obsessive detailing, of piling on so many inconsequential facts and figures that the characters and stories get buried under the scree, as if the author secretly hopes that by spending most of the chapter describing the hero s cuirass, we'll forget that he s a bland archetype who only succeeds through happy coincidence and against an enemy with no internal structure or motivation.\n\nWhen Quiller-Couch said authors should  murder their darlings , this is what he meant: just because you have hobbies and opinions does not mean you should fill your novel with them. Anything which does not materially contribute to the story, characters, and artistry of a work can safely be left out. Tolkien's embarrassment of detail also produced a huge inflation in the acceptable length of fantasy books, leading to the meandering, unending series that fill bookstore shelves today.\n\nNow, there are several notable critics who have lamented the unfortunate effect that Tolkien s work has had on the genre, such as in Moorcock s and Mieville s about every modern fantasy author being forced to come to terms with the old don's influence. I agree with their deconstructions, but for me, Tolkien isn t some special author, some  fantasy granddad  looming over all. He s just a bump in the road, one author amongst many in a genre that stretches back thousands of years into our very ideas of myth and identity, and not one of the more interesting ones\n\nHis ideas weren t unique, and while his approach may have been unusual, it was only because he spent a lifetime , despite the fact that the point of fantasy (and fiction in general) is to explore the artificial, the human side of the equation, to look at the world through the biased lens of our eye and to represent some odd facet of the human condition. Unfortunately, Tolkien s characters, structure, and morality are all too flat to suggest much, no matter how many faux-organic details he surrounds them with.\n\nShow more",

            "content": "Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,\nSeven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,\nNine for Mortal Men doomed to die,\nOne for the Dark Lord on his dark throne\nIn the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.\n\nOne Ring to rule them all,\nOne Ring to find them,\nOne Ring to bring them all\nAnd in the darkness bind them\nIn the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.\n\nThree thousand years after the defeat of the Dark Lord Sauron before the slopes of Mount Doom, a magic ring falls into the care of Frodo Baggins, a young hobbit from the Shire. Aided by his gardener Samwise Gamgee and the mysterious wizard Gandalf the Grey, he takes the ring on a journey to Rivendell, a hidden refuge of the Elves. But evil stirs in the fell lands of Mordor, and black riders scour the countryside in search of their master s most prized possession \n\nThus begins the most legendary saga in the history of fantasy.\n\n\n\nI ll kick off this review by telling a little story. A story starting, as the stories often do, with 'once upon a time'...\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a little boy who have never read a fantasy book. Thinking back on it, it does seem like an awfully sorry state of affairs. He was a devoted reader already as a quite small child, but he mostly read children s books like and other juvenile and boyish stories like them. The one day he discovered this huge brick called , and started reading it. It would change his life forever. There were other books at the time, for instance the immensely popular series, which was being published back then, but none of them could ever hope to compare to what was now the little boy s favourite book.\n\nThe little boy grew into adolescence. He read other books, few of them fantasy. He discovered a passion for history, and started reading that. He read classics and sci-fi and mysteries and even religious texts. He read books considered by some as among the best books ever. And none of them could ever hope to compare to what was still the boy s favourite book.\n\nLater that little boy would grow up to become a man (though he probably never will grow up completely, mind you). And he started reading fantasy again. was one of the first attempts, and it quickly turned into a favourite. But compared to ? Nothing. It was followed by tons of other fantasy series, among them , , and so on. And he loved them all. But every once in a while, he had to go back to this huge brick to remember that there existed something even better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been struggling for years to describe . How do you actually describe the book you both love more than any other, and also consider the best book ever written from a more or less objective point of view?\n\nI recently dumped into the word sublime, which I ve only heard used on a few occasions before. I knew what it meant, but not the exact definition. So I checked.\n\n- Of high spiritual, moral, or intellectual worth.\n- Not to be excelled; supreme.\n- Inspiring awe; impressive.\n- An ultimate example.\n\nAnd that is pretty much exactly how I would describe it. Sublime it is. I realised that I would never come closer to an actual description of . This is to me not only the main pillar on which the fantasy genre stands, but the ultimate masterpiece of literature.\n\nI ll use a far-fetched example to put my love for this book in perspective: if I had to choose between reading this book once and having unlimited access to all the other books ever released, then I would choose this. No contest even.\n\nI am so very grateful to have been given the chance to come along on the journey of the Fellowship of the Ring. To visit so many wonderful places in a land of myths and magic. To meet so many fascinating men, elves, dwarves and other legendary peoples and creatures...\n\nAre there any negative things to mention? No. In my mind there are none at all, but I ll say this: Tolkien s characters are not the best I have encountered, and the storyline of this book is not perfect. That s the closest you ll ever come to witness me criticizing this wondrous gem, and the only things you ll ever hear from me about it except for fanatical ravings and unsolicited praise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf perfection exists and is obtainable, then Tolkien s worldbuilding is perfect. There is nothing in either fantasy or any other genre to match it. It certainly surpassed all the magical worlds that had come before it, and none created since that time have been able to surpass it in turn. Writers like Robert Jordan and George R.R. Martin have made their attempts, and now we re talking about more of my all-time favourite fantasy worlds and series, but in my eyes, none of them have even come close.\n\nI have had tons of delightful experiences while venturing into magnificent worlds of fantasy, in Westeros and Narnia and so many others. But Middle-Earth is like a fictional home. I seem to have left behind parts of my heart and soul by the waterfalls of Rivendell, the ancient trees of Fangorn forest, the plains of Rohan and the marble walls of Minas Tirith. And I do not regret that for one second.\n\nMost of my standards for comparison also derive from this tome. I have yet to encounter a mentor character in fantasy who can compare to Gandalf, or a fictional love story that can compare to the tale of Aragorn and Arwen. I have yet to encounter a setting as detailed or writing as flawlessly eloquent as this. And those are only a few examples of aspects in which I consider to be superior to all others.\n\nThese musings can only begin to describe how much this book means to me. It sparked my passion for reading at a young age. It made me love the fantasy genre and all that came with it. It made me start creating worlds of my own, and in the end find one in particular that I liked so much I started writing stories set in it. Why, it even made me intrigued by poetry eventually. But I have yet to read anything by any famous poet that can match Tolkien s utterly incredible poems.\n\nOn my third and fourth and fifth reads of this book, I started looking beyond the immediately visible. And I found something more to admire: the man himself. John Ronald Reuel Tolkien went on to become my most important role model, and despite having been gone from this world for forty years, he s been heavily influencing my personal opinions and choices for more than a decade. And not only literarily, but historically, politically and philosophically as well.\n\nThis book is definitely the one single object that s had the most impact on me, and it s meant a lot more to me than one should think any object could be capable of. But then again it s not really an object after all. It is so much more. A legend trapped in words on pieces of paper. A magical gateway to the most amazing world you ll ever see.\n\nThis is to me the apex of human creativity and imagination. The very best form of art a human mind can produce.\n\nThere have been many books that I have cherished through the years, and I expect there will be many more to come. But will always be the one I treasure the most of them all.\n\nIt has changed me forever. As it once changed the world forever.\n\n\n\nSo that's all I have to say for now. I'm afraid this was not so much an actual review as simply a story about my experience with and passion for this book. If you've been patient enough to read to the very end, I thank you for your attention. I'll leave you with the most beautiful passage Tolkien ever wrote, and my favourite literary quote of all time...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more",

            "content": "Lord of the Rings\n\nI have read LotR many times over the years, in fact it is I think the book I have read the most in this world, which i suppose makes it my favourite book, albeit closely followed by half a dozen others (shout if you want to know or take a gander at my favourites shelf).\nI have always enjoyed it, understatement, but for some reason this re-read is more special than ever. I had almost forgotten how much was different from the films, and despite having read LotR once before since the films, I seem to be getting more from the book this time than ever before.\n\n\n\nAs part of a buddy read, I have just completed the first book of the trilogy, and have given it 5   . As anyone who actually reads my reviews will know, I very rarely need to use spoilers as I leave other people to read the book themselves, so you will find no or few spoilers in this review. The (first) book weaves an amazing tale with incredible characters in a well constructed world. The characters and situations make you smile, laugh and even cry as the journey begins, the Fellowship is put together and at the close of this book, so cruelly broken. Having somehow forgotten the differences to the film, I thoroughly enjoyed the differences, especially Tom Bombardil and the river daughter, and surprisingly I enjoyed all the poems, some brought tears to my eyes, is it the first time I have really read them ??\n\nFebruary 2019 brings...\n\n\n\nAnd so here we are 20th Feb 2019 and I've finished Book 2. I must admit I had wondered if after such a gap from reading LotR and watching the films so many times if I would enjoy the book(s) as much, I think I can now 2/3rds of the way through safely say that somehow the film experience has made me love the book more (if that is possible).\nAgain I think the book well outshines the film although the people I see inhabiting the characters are those from the films. There are again differences which , yes, once again I prefer in the book; the way the film is split up so we follow both parts of the journey (understandably) is not as good if one is reading all of LotR as following the Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli side first and then the Frodo/Sam side second; also\nVarious other small differences occur but I will leave you to discover.\nSuffice to say the story continues apace and one falls in love with the characters even more. One is there fighting alongside them or willing them on when the going gets tough. The poems and rhymes again were a revelation to me and made the story even more enchanting, enthralling and yes again emotional. It is slightly unsettling to be sitting on one's sofa on a Wednesday afternoon, fire lit, surrounded by ones three cats, sipping from a giant mug of coffee and finding tears streaming down ones face as you attempt to read what has become of the valiant loyal Sam or how Gandalf was returned to Middle Earth as the leader of his order. Most unsettling, hmm is it age ??\nAnd now I must again wait until next month to start book 3, such willpower ha ha.\n\n\n\nSo here we are in March and the final book of the trilogy, and what an epic finale it is. Again different to the film, but yet again immeasurably superior.\nI put \"just\" in my marking of 5 stars and I think it is only just a five star read. Nothing is really \"wrong\" with this book, it just isn't as good ad the previous 2 in my opinion. Yes the battles are more epic, the journeys are more dangerous, the stakes are even higher (the safety of the the world) and the finale in Mordor is unbelievably dramatic but for some reason, despite being truly emotional about many scenes, yes there were tears rolling down my face, I still felt it was for some reason just not quite as good.\nThat said it was still amazing writing, both tense and dramatic, with pure poetry scenes littered throughout the book (Faramir and Eowyn in the House of Healing) (the decision by Arwen Evenstar to accept a mortal life with Aragon) (Sam's determination to get to the top of Mount Doom) and enough cliffhangers to last a lifetime.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd so for this year and maybe the next few, I come to the end of this unbelievably emotional reunion with my favourite book. I think it reaffirms my view that the films are good, but the book is another level and just truly awesome. I look forward to both discovering even more in my next read and being reduced to an emotional wreck yet again.\nShow more",

Well, people say good things happen slowly, so I don t regret the journey one bit.\n\nSomething crosses my mind that Terry Pratchett has shared in  A Slip of the Keyboard . He was 12 or 13 when he read  The Lord of the Rings  for the first time. His parents left him at some neighbors  house to babysit their children while all the adults went visit somebody. To pass the time Terry (who as all boys wasn t very keen on reading) got absorbed in the  LoTR  and suddenly the Shire had spread out in his imagination and the edges of the shabby carpet turned in the Shire s borders and beyond them adventures were awaiting. So, Terry Pratchett read all night long and for the whole next day too. He read the novel for 26 hours (with some small breaks, of course   the bladder of a 12-year-old is not a water-skin after all). In the years to come he continued to reread the book each year. This is how it goes, brilliant minds resonate in accord.\n\nWhen I was almost finished with the novel I realized that  The Lord of the Rings  is actually an allegory of the human life. There is a spirit of idyll in the Shire, days are lazy and sometimes tinted with mischievousness, and Gandalf s visits are sheer feasts   that looks very much like childhood perhaps. Then you step outside the hobbit hole and the limits of the known and you plunge into adventures   you had been yearning so much to lose those familiar faces for a while and see if some glorious song might be sung for you too. The journey starts jolly, one repast follows another (the food in the first part is indeed quite abundant   Tolkien himself says that ), you sing songs, admire everything new and your eyes are as big as pancakes as you try to perceive all novelties that happen to you   I suppose that s the period of youth. After that though you slowly realize that you carry a truly heavy burden on your shoulders, that you have responsibilities and failure means too much, it means the world. Songs are noticeably fewer, you sing once in a blue moon and it s only to give yourself courage and to remember the past when things used to be simple, and not to enjoy yourself. And like in life there are glimpses of hope, but also precipitous collapses in pitch-dark depths, you are sometimes alone among the multitude and sometimes there is a friend to lend you a helping hand, and you put one foot in front of the other and keep going because you know that nobody is going to wage that battle for you. And you rely on the flickering hope that one day you could sigh  I m finally back .\n\nThere is some very sweet melancholy seeped through Tolkien s world or at least I felt it that way.

            "content": "I loved returning to Middle-Earth <3\nEverything is so lovingly crafted in The Lord of the Rings and has such background and history, like a perfect clockwork.\nSome random observations per book below, if one has never read the books or seen the movie don't dive in.\n\nPrologue:\n- Interesting how the prologue is an info dump on hobbits and smoking, far from a traditional setup of a large adventure\n- The last prologue says a lot about the fourth age, and sons of characters we well known from LotR\n\n\n- How old do hobbits become normally that 33 is the threshold of adulthood?\n- 22 september is Bilbo/Frodo day!\n- If that s queer, we could do with a bit more queerness in this parts   \n- Gandalf has a blue hat?\n- - #burn\n- The Not In My Time speech   \n- Sauron believed that the elves had destroyed his ring? Then he would have been dead, wouldn t he?\n- Gildor the vague, not providing an escort despite of mortal danger...\n- How does Frodo s new house have three baths?\n- The moving trees of the old wood seem to foreshadow the Ents later on\n- The venture into the Old Forest feels very much like the\n- The singing in the audiobook is so weird to hear\n- Tom Bombadil talking about himself in third person   \n- Pippin being an idiot already comes back in the Prancing Pony\n\n\n- Glory and crumpets, bless Sam his sayings\n- Everything starts of good when someone gets power, and then... - Gandalf\n- Just change your means - Saruman\n- Gandalf fangirling about his horse\n- One does not simply walk into Mordor is something missing in the book to give Boromir a bit of spice\n- Elrond not pressing the departure of Pippin to the Shire        \n- Love Moria, very well paced, and the out-of-time depiction of Lothlorien made me fall in love with Elves\n- Sam his dedication to Frodo is the emotional highlight of the book\n- So much songs, like a musical (which strangely enough bombed)\n- The feeling of decline is interesting compared to the modern belief in progress\n\n\n- Aragorn his self doubt is quite interesting.\n- Aragorn s and Eomer their banter in chapter 2 gives me  You hang up first  vibes\n- I talk a lot to myself since it is easier to talk to the smartest one in the company - Gandalf being humble\n- Eowyn being thirsty for Aragorn near instantly...\n- The Helmsdeep battle in the movie was much more epic than in the book\n- Theoden against Saruman: I will have peace with you after you re hung from a gibbet #wow\n-\n- Forgive you? First tell me what you ve done - Gandalf to Pippin\n\n\n- Frodo his  all my choice have turned out ill  in the first chapter mirrors that sentiment of Aragorn at the start of book 3\n- Faramir dissing his brother subtly\n- Sam s and Frodo s goodbye is so emotional, as is him protecting him while sleeping\n- Well the end is a cliffhanger if ever there was one\n\n\n- Pippin being a  young  hobbit: 29? Wow, child of Minas Tirith, at least Pippin didn t die at the ripe age of childbirth\n- Ok  the summoning of the dead in the movie is much more dramatic and well done than in the book\n- The true abusive father: Denethor\n- Well that s a bit extreme Denethor\n- Who covered for Eowyn back home in Rohan?\n- Merry his sentiment  Why did I decided to go?  is very relatable\n-\n- Fell is his favorite word, that much is sure\n- The heathen kings, an interesting concept without a pope or some kind of organized religion\n- Blind in your obedience- Gandalf doesn t suffer fools or order is order defences\n- Only 7.000 in the army send towards the black gate\n\n\n- It was Frodo, he was naked   \n- Orcs are their own worst enemies once again\n- If Sam had kept stewardship of the ring everything would have ended much more smoothly\n- They woke together, hand in hand - I m serious, Sam his dedication is the single most emotional thing in this book\n- Filthy shriekers, orcs have nice nick-names for Nazgul\n- You are beautiful - subtle, Faramir, subtle\n- Sam s girl is sassy\n\n\n- Honestly maybe my favourite part, seeing how Tolkien thought of almost literally everything while writing this humongous book.\nShow more",

            "content": "Save time... watch the movies. This book can appeal only to a linguist. The underlying story is great, but it is buried under an avalance of horribly annoying songs and poems that do nothing to advance the story. They just take up space. I diligently read every last one, hoping that they held some deep meaning in relation to the story, but if there is one, it is so obscure that it serves no purpose. Also, the book is all about walking. Yes, I know they are on an epic quest, and there has to be soul-searching, etc., but the amount of detail regarding the walking is a snoozer! 45 pages of walking and 3 pages for a huge battle. AUGH! I know that this is a masterpiece, and I agree that the plot line is a beautiful tale of good and evil and power and corruption. However, reading this series was a drudgery. The only really good part that you miss in the movies is when the hobits return to the Shire in the last three chapters of The Return of the King. If you want a Tolkien fix, I'd reccommend The Hobbit.\nShow more",

Un Anillo para encontrarlos, un Anillo para atraerlos a todos y atarlos a las tinieblas en la Tierra de Mordor donde se extienden las Sombras.\"\n\nRealmente es admirable lo que han logrado autores como J.R.R. Tolkien as  tambi n como H.P. Lovecraft, George R.R. Martin, C.S. Lewis o J.K Rowling.\nEl hecho de que estos escritores puedan crear todo un universo entero, una mitolog a de personajes, lugares e historias es algo realmente poderoso y muy dif cil de imitar y considero que son autores tocados por la genialidad y dif cilmente puedan ser igualados en la literatura.\nLo que J.R.R. Tolkien ha hecho creando esta historia del Se or de los Anillos es  pico y genial.\nPor primera vez decid  apartarme de la literatura cl sica o tradicional para adentrarme en este mundo m gico creado por este prol fico escritor ingl s.\nHace mucho tiempo me hab a comprado una hermosa caja con los tres libros y sent a que era el momento de darle una oportunidad y aunque hab a visto las pel culas a las cuales tengo en dvd no recordaba muy bien el desarrollo de la historia, raz n por lo cual decid  leer la trilog a.\nIndependientemente de su fant stica mente capaz de crear todo el mundo de paisajes, historia y personajes de la Tierra Media, me resisto a creer que Tolkien no se haya inspirado en distintos libros cl sicos de la literatura universal (aunque esta es mi postura personal, no la que realmente haya sucedido) puesto que en muchos casos las similitudes son llamativas y sali ndome del an lisis de esta grandiosa trilog a que para m  no es necesario ya que se solventa por s  misma; me gustar a se alar algunas cosas que pude descubrir mientras la le a.\nInvestigando un poco me entero de que su inspiraci n tal vez se inici  en \"El anillo de los Nibelungos\", obra maestra del compositor Richard Wagner, as  tambi n como el poema  pico \"Beowulf\", la epopeya finesa \"Kalevala\" y toda la mitolog a n rdica.\nYo por mi parte encuentro que algunos cap tulos en los que Tolkien describe las batallas a las que deben enfrentarse Aragorn, Gandalf, Boromir, Th oden e incluso los hobbits, (tomemos por ejemplo el caso del cap tulo \"El abismo de Helm\" de \"Las dos torres\"), poseen componentes que aluden a la  Il ada  o la  Odisea  de Homero como tambi n a  Ivanhoe  de Sir Walter Scott, los caballeros templarios y todo lo inherente a la  poca medieval, m s precisamente en lo que a descripci n de las batallas respecta.\nIncluso podr a decir que las novelas de caballer a cl sica -sea  Don Quijote de la Mancha , el  Orlando Furioso  y hasta me atrever a a nombrar el  Amadis de Gaula - son una referencia clara cuando el autor describe f sicamente a Aragorn o al rey Th oden y a sus acciones en batalla.\nEs m s, encuentro algunos di logos profundamente shakesperianos.\nAlgo similar sucede en el viaje que inician Frodo y Sam hacia los dominios de Mordor, ya que la descripci n gr fica, desoladora y verdaderamente terror fica que Tolkien hace de la Ci naga de los muertos previo a las puertas de Mordor es digno del \"Infierno\" de \"La divina comedia\" de Dante Alighieri por los escalofr os que produce leer ese pasaje.\nEn otro momento de la novela, en la lucha entre Sam y Ella-Lara a, cuando Sam le clava la espada  lfica de Frodo, Dardo, en el vientre me llev  a ese instante  pico en el que el capit n Ahab le clava el arp n a Moby Dick antes de ser engullido por la ballena blanca en el mar.\nY el viaje de Aragorn por el Sendero de los Muertos inexorablemente remite al descenso de Eneas a los infiernos en la  Eneida  de Virgilio.\nRepito que lo que escribo en esta rese a es mi visi n personal de lo le do y de ning n modo afirmo que Tolkien haya tenido tales inspiraciones. Usualmente cuando leo, suelo realizar todo tipo de asociaciones literarias que van surgiendo en mi cabeza.\nLo que me ha dejado muy impresionado tambi n es la concepci n de Tolkien de toda la mitolog a, de los nombres de los personajes que estimo ha partido de la mitolog a n rdica, de crear un nuevo lenguaje, el  lfico y de la invenci n de los distintos pueblos, ciudadelas, la Comarca y muchas locaciones m s.\nEs realmente brillante. No hay otra manera de describir semejante poder o imaginativo y conceptual, aunque hay que entender que Tolkien invirti  toda su vida en el desarrollo de este universo.\nMe llevo la m s grata impresi n de la lectura de esta trilog a y siento que me pude dar un gusto que a veces los puristas lectores de cl sicos tratan de esconder.\nSiempre digo que en literatura hay que tratar de leerlo todo y los mundos de J.R.R. Tolkien son una buena oportunidad para hacerlo.\nShow more",

            "content": "I will write three separate reviews and combine them here as I think all three books cover so much that I need to put my thoughts down.\n\nSo here is my review-within-a-review for\nThe Fellowship of the Ring:\n\nI read this the first time as a young teen but really didn't appreciate it much. I came to know about Hobbits through school mates who kept talking abpout the then upcoming first movie by Peter Jackson. I went to watch it but was unimpressed, almost bored even (until the last quarter at least). I loved the mythology but little else. Nevertheless, I got the book (and went to the trouble of finding and buying a special edition which was not easy back then). I read it but most went over my head.\nToday I want to spank myself (and not in a good way) for ever thinking like that. Because if you know the book, and maybe as well, you can see just how much of a fan Peter Jackson is. Sooo many details only insiders will recognize. And the book is a thing to behold. But I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nThis first part introduces us to the world of Middle-Earth (Arda). There, elves, trolls, hobbits, goblins, orks, giant eagles and wolves, but also more sinister things dwell. And wizards, though I think that name is misleading here. Great evil has this world seen in the past and while it was defeated, it is on the rise again as these things are wont to do. Sauron is the name of the great evil here and a long time ago he forged a ring of power to bind all other rings as well as people of Middle-Earth. And just like a certain dark wizard of a more modern tale, he poured his soul into this master ring so it didn't matter when his body got destroyed thousands of years before the events of this first book. But this ring has been found now - by one of the most innocent creatures in this world, of all things.\nThe alliance that failed to vanquish evil from the world thousands of years ago is now represented in the titular fellowship comprising of a dwarf, an elf, two men, a wizard and four hobbits. And they march to destroy the ring - and thus evil - before Sauron can restore himself to his full power again.\nTheir quest leads them through forests, over mountains, on streams and through mines. But that is not the most important part, actually.\n\nMost important is the fact that Tolkien was a wordsmith. He was not only a scholar at one of THE most famous universities in the world; he was not only fluent in several languages; he was not only keen on any mythology you can think of. He combined all of that in his writing. Apparently, he didn't write it to get published, thinking nobody would be interested, and thus wrote to his heart's content.\nHe included songs and poems, stating more than once that true magic lies in both (as is represented by the elves for example). His nature descriptions are not only sweeping and vivid, but also utterly beautiful. His dialogues, while being quite wordy, are fluent and artistic.\nHe INVENTED several languages for this book - complete with grammar and all. Linguists have marvelled over Tolkien's affinity and mastery for generations and I feel the same. Many authors use made-up languages but not a single one of them actually sat down and drew up one as whole as Tolkien did.\n\nThus, Tolkien has truly created an entire world, complete with art, history, mythology, geography (look at those gorgeous maps), politics, different peoples, languages ...\n\nThe only thing he didn't manage to convey as wonderfully as Peter Jackson with his films was the action. At least not here in the first book. It is suspenseful, but the impact of the encounter with the Balrog for example was much more touching and shocking in the movie (at least to me). The same goes for Arwen and Frodo being chased by the Black Riders until they cross the stream around Rivendell.\nMaybe it's because he was fed up with war (he fought in WW1) or maybe he wanted to hold back and then hit the reader with full force in the end battle. Or he just didn't have the same concept of action as most of us do nowadays. I'm not quite sure. Nevertheless, one feels the pathos (look up the original word and its meaning), one believes the characters when they act out of integrity and honour and never once thinks it's pretentious of them (again, the Boromir-scene in the movie makes me cry, the one in the book didn't).\n\nI've re-watched the (extended version of the) first movie and I've noticed sooo many details I had missed before, it was astonishing. The tale (in any medium) is packed with details enriching both the world and the reader's/viewer's experience on a level unmatched and I'm more than happy that Peter Jackson was able to translate that so wonderfully onto the screen (it doesn't happen often).\n\n\n\nThis second book had fewer songs and poems and yes, I missed them. Oh, there are some, like the funny songs of Sm agol/Gollum or some of Sam's rhymes, but it's not the same as the elaborate songs of the elves.\n\nIn this second part of the trilogy, the fellowship has broken up. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas are persuing the Uruk'hai and orks that have taken Merry and Pippin while Frodo and Sam are trying to find their way to Mordor. The former soon meet the horse lords of Rohan and find out that a lost friend has returned while the latter encounter Sm agol/Gollum and let themselves be guided by him. Whether or not that is a good idea remains to be seen.\nMoreover, Saruman is showing his true (multi) colours and thus sends an army to destroy Rohan and its inhabitants. But he didn't count on Merry and Pippin making some new friends in Fangorn forest and then there are also the Rohirrim, the formidable cavalry of the horse lords.\n\nThis second volume certainly saw more action. However, much like in the first book, many of those scenes were handled slightly better in the movie (I shall re-watch the second one tomorrow or the day after).\nWhat the book has that the movie simply couldn't have, is a certain depth.\nAll the history of the last big battle against Sauron and what happened to the alliance of elves and men back then, the people of the south and their tendency to immediately follow Sauron, the proud but hopeless people of Gondor that we glimpse through Boromir's brother Faramir, ... there is sooo much to tell and not enough time or not enough pages to do so. However, Tolkien letting some characters tell of their experiences or their ancestors' experiences was a brilliant way of including the history of Middle-Earth that has passed into legends. And since every creature experiences history differently, we get a multi-faceted look through different eyes of different corners of the world.\n\nMost interesting to me were the Ents. Not just Treebeard but the others, too, especially the mysterious loss of the Ent-Wives. There are one or two possibilities what Treebeard means when he says \"we lost them\" and it was fun for me as a reader to dwell on what the most likely story was. Not to mention that I love trees and everything green and the message of the Ents' struggle through time is clear enough (especially nowadays what with the even more apparent results of climate change). However, it was also extremely satisfying to see them fighting back and kicking ass.\nNevertheless, here, too, there was a scene I preferred in the movie as that one conveyed an additional message seen throughout Peter Jackson's trilogy: that nobody can just sit this one out, that all people/races must come together, work together, if they want evil to be defeated. We are seeing it with the elves and the tree shepherds aren't any different.\n\nAs I mentioned in the beginning of this mini-review, this second volume had a bit less of Tolkien's wordshmithery, his awesome poems and songs. Instead, we got more fast-paced action sequences that were also slightly better done than the ones in the first book. But never fear, the writing style is still gorgeous and the descriptions astonishingly vivid and colourful, opening up distant corners we hadn't been to yet and introducing even weirder creatures of Middle-Earth than we've seen so far.\n\n\n\nThe conclusion of the trilogy has us follow Gimli, Legolas and Aragorn as they lead the realms of men against the Army of Darkness while we also still follow Sam and Frodo (yes, surprise, he's not dead after all ;P) on their way to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring.\nAs such, we see Saruman imprisoned by Treebeard and his Ents, we learn of and see in action the Army of the Dead, we still shudder because of a certain giant spider, fret over Boromir's little brother and we wait for Gollum to make a comeback to get is prrrrrreciouzzzzzz. Most of all, though, we see a massive clash of forces and have the privilege of seeing some truly delightful characters beat the living shit out of the bad guys (Eowyn, anyone?) before evil is conquered and the Hobbits get an adventure in the Shire that people who have only seen the movie will never know about (and which was pretty epic).\nIn the end, we get to say goodbye to all these lovely creatures we've journeyed together with, that we've laughed and cried with, whom we care about and kept our fingers crossed for. For, sadly, the age of magic is over and the age of man is upon us. And no, I don't like it one bit.\n\nTolkien ramped up the action for this one the most. The satisfying conclusion to all the build-up and while I still think that the movie managed to make me gasp more, he turned out to be wonderfully skilled in describing honourable sacrifices as much as impressive sword fights. My favourite is, of course, Eowyn taking out the Witch-King of Angmar. Granted, that, too, was done better in the movie (\n), just like the succession of Rohan's rulers was better in the movie. While I always try to factor in the time any given book was written in and the environment in which the respective author grew up in, I know from other material, material written before LOTR, that Tolkien could do better female characters so Eowyn and Arwen felt like a waste (especially when compared with how wonderfully Peter Jackson had done them). Still, it's not exactly awful - you could say this is nitpicking on the highest level. *lol*\n\nThe writing style never wavered, never got any less impressive and awe-inspiring than in the previous chapters. One of the most amazing things is that I really got the impression of having been on a journey for a year or more with these people, so much has happened and so realistically did Tolkien portray the events as much as the sceneries.\nMoreover, here, we had more songs and poems again and the magic they envoked was palpable for me as a reader once more. The heaviness of the Mordor chapters was immediately lifted when Sam would start up a tune or a rhyme so Tolkien was right about the magic.\n\nWe all know that this story isn't about Frodo. On the surface some might presume so, but they'd be utterly wrong. Anyone can see clear as day that it's Sam's story. But for those who needed a moment longer, I shall simply quote the author and indeed the character himself:\n\nMakes me cry EVERY.DAMN.TIME.\n\nSo yes, this is as epic as it comes advertised and I don't think anyone could doubt why it had such an influence on the writers and readers and movie / TV show creators of this world.\n\nI shall re-watch this last movie, too, of course and am already looking forward to discovering yet more details I couldn't know about the very first time I saw the movie. I already learned a bit of trivia that astonished me (like the fact that I discovered only now that Aunt Zelda of the new series is Eowyn! or that that actress only got the role after Elsa from declined the role - I can so NOT picture that woman as Eowyn)! You see: lots to see, every time and I'm glad we, as readers (but in this case also as watchers) have such impressive realms to dwell in and so many lessons to learn there, too.\n\nThis concludes a re-read of epic proportions and I'm glad I let myself be persuaded to do it as I had indeed forgotten most of what made the books be different and I have to (still shamefacedly) admit that my much younger self absolutely did not appreciate the richness portrayed in the author's linguistic craftmanship as much as I should have back then.\n\n\n\nEdit: I've re-watched the last movie today and have to point out once again how much I love that Peter Jackson makes Faramir give up whatever position he might have gotten in Gondor in favour of following his wife because SHE is a ruler. Just like I love that Theoden came up with the idea of making Eowyn his heir and no Eomer in between, simply because she was the right choice.\nShow more",

            "content": "I read Lord of the Rings first when I was about eleven or so, and then stayed up all night at a hip boy/girl party in the bathroom with Nathan O. ... talking about ents and elves and whether Tom Bombadil was God. Yes, I was a geeky child. However, all these years later, the story has stuck with me.\n\nFirst a warning: Don't read Tolkien if you don't appreciate true-omnicient-narrator-style epics. Tolkien isn't a master character builder: he leaves all that to the reader's imagination. The agony in the Aragorn/Arwen romance -- so blatant and operatic in the movies -- was a longing look on Strider's face at Rivendell, an odd comment from Bilbo, and a short no-nonsense Appendix. As with many of the themes in this work, the romance and deep character relationships must be picked from between the lines.\n\nAnd there is so much between the lines here. The world of Middle-earth lives, utterly lives. Instead of tugging on what-ifs, this fantasy forces readers to imagine. Tolkien's work is the fullest realization of literary world building ever penned.\n\nIt is also sophisticated writing, drawing on older forms (epic, romance, tragedy). Tolkien doesn't waste time writing snappy dialogue: the story is too epic to dwindle to individual persons. However, voice shifts subtly depending on point of view: chapters dealing with hobbits contain much more dialogue and detail; chapters dealing with Rohirrim have a poetic rhythm reminiscent of extant Middle English works; chapters dealing with elves are magic and blurry and hard to wrap a mind around. These shifts in style, far from being a novice writer's oops, are intentional and serve as mass characterisation of races and groups. So, what Tolkien foregoes in terms of dialogue he replaces with style and action: a classic example of show not tell.\n\nHaving just spouted all that praise, I have to admit that all the criticisms are true: the story does resound with Luddite anti-industrial metaphors, overt Christian themes of salvation and spirit, a structural decision to include songs that doesn't quite work, and fantasy tropes that are now cliche ... now that everyone else has copied them, that is. The thing to remember is that this book started the genre: everything fantasy, from Philip Pullman to George RR Martin, exists in the shadow of this opus.\n\nSo, no, it isn't a popcorn read. Get over it. If you invest the time and spirit to read this work, you will be glad you did.\nShow more",

But I think these are better than we give them credit for.\n\nNot to show up and act like J.R.R. Tolkein was some misunderstood genius. But it s fascinating to me that this book was foundational to modern high fantasy, a genre which I think plays a lot with cruelty: the brutal world, the betrayal of friends. Tolkein s novels do not revolve around complex moral codes; they do not question whether there is good and evil, or who is who. The fundamental hero of this story is love.\n\nIt's no accident that the hero of this series is the most underestimated of all people: a Hobbit. There are the godly elves, but this series focuses on men's capacity to fail and triumph. The outsiders save the world.\n\nI think, all the time, about the fact that were it not for one moment of pity Frodo takes, on someone who he knows will try to hurt him, this entire story would have been different would have ended on a far, far darker note.\n\n(On weekends, I also take time to think very deeply about Sam s role in the series, and the fact that his love and loyalty saves Frodo and, by extent, the world. Within this narrative love saves the world.)\n\nThe biggest flaw is that Tolkein could not edit to save his life. I will not elaborate on that beyond to say he would dedicate at least five pages to explaining the concept. I m going to keep it very, very real: my love for this comes partially from just how much I adore . This is genuinely the #1 series in the world where I think the movie adaptation is superior in quality to the books. I ve watched them so many times. I think every time I watch them I end up adding a few sentences to this review because I m full of Thoughts and Tenderness. The movies are my favorite and always worth a watch.\n\nShow more",

My beginning with this particular book occurred on a wedding anniversary date. I was a few cran and vodkas over the limit and had decided that a nice leisurely stroll through the bookstore would help clear my head before venturing on to our next destination, the grocery store. Yes, you read that right. My anniversary date celebration consisted of booze, books and groceries. I m pretty sure if you google anniversary gifts by year for the modern working couple with children you will see this exact scenario listed under year sixteen. If it isn t there I vote it should be because silver hollowware, who actually wants that?\n\n\n\nWhen I happened upon this ginormous book in all of its leather bound glory I knew that I had to possess it. I realized that buying it would force me to read it sooner than later and it was a book that had lived on my mental to-read list for a very long time. What I didn t consider was the size of the book and how difficult it would be for me to lug it around everywhere I went. Sober me would have thought of this and went for the story broken out across three books instead of one. Tipsy me saw the fancy binding, smelled the pages and could care less about my future suffering. I saw my precious and nothing was going to stop me from making it my own, especially not commonsense.\n\nMy reading stretched on for weeks on end and every day the book got heavier and more cumbersome . A few chapters in and I decided to get a tote to make my traveling easier and to protect my precious from rain, stains and torn pages. I was Frodo and the tote became my Sam. Without my durable new friend I would have been miserable and it would have taken me a hell of a lot longer to finish one of the best stories I have read in a while. I also wouldn t have been able to enjoy the characters I had fallen hard for in all of the various locations I was able to visit because of it. Exciting locations such as the doctor s waiting room and a hotel room in Texas, to name a few.\n\nFive stars to a book that taught me to appreciate epic journeys and all of the friends you might find along the way and zero stars to a specific edition of that same book that taught me not to visit the bookstore under the influence of alcohol.\nShow more",

This edition had appendices innthe back to help with time lines, back story, and touched on a lot of the mythos based in Tolkien's world.

            "content": "Note, Sept. 18, 2020: I just edited this review again, to delete the word \"trilogy\" since a reader made a comment objecting to it. (Strictly speaking, Tolkien did envision the LOTR books as a single long novel --which, in terms of plot structure, it actually is-- not a trilogy in the usual sense. It's just published in three volumes because its sheer length makes it unwieldy in one.)\n\nNote, March 11, 2019: I just edited this review to insert an accidentally omitted word.\n\nActually, I read Tolkien's masterful Middle Earth fantasy corpus, beginning with in the early 70's and finishing almost a decade later, before this anniversary edition came out. (I also read all four books to my wife in the early 80's; she loved them too!)\n\nThis body of work is, of course, genre-defining classic of modern fantasy --especially epic, or \"high\" fantasy -- which popularized the genre as the publishing market force it is today, exerted enormous influence over practically all subsequent fantasy authors (including R. A. Salvatore and Terry Brooks), and set the conventions readers would come to expect: a pre-technological setting, an epochal struggle between good and evil whose outcome is determined by magical factors, and a demand for personal moral growth on the part of the characters thrust into a pivotal role in that struggle. And Tolkien's depictions of wizards, elves, dwarfs, dragons, etc. became the template for all subsequent portrayals of these creatures.\n\nPart of the success of Tolkien's work derives from the breath- taking scope of his world-building, which reflects his day jobs as a philologist and medievalist; he created entire languages and folklores for his \"Middle Earth,\" as well as a detailed, millenia-spanning history. But more importantly, as a devout Catholic, he embodied his deeply Christian world-view in the writing: his fantasy world (though he doesn't employ the kind of explicit Christian symbolism that C. S. Lewis does) is the scene of conflict between good and evil with world-altering significance, under a superintending Providence, in which the individual moral choices of both the high and the lowly have significance, and temptation is an ever-present danger.\nShow more",

            "content": "I have read J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings probably (and this truly is but a very conservative estimate) at least fifteen or more times since my mid twenties (I did first attempt it at the age of twelve but my English language skills were at that time not sufficiently fluent to appreciate The Lord of the Rings for the masterpiece it is, so I am glad I gave up to try again later). And indeed, I have also never once perused The Lord of the Rings as an actual trilogy, as I have always considered it as ONE entity and a single reading period of time (mostly because I have never even remotely believed that , and should in any manner be considered as stand alone novels in and of themselves and therefore that they really do require a perusal as one all encompassing work of epical fiction, and by the way, not as an allegory, as I have also and indeed never believed those critics who claim that is supposed to represent an allegory against war or against National Socialism).\n\nAnd indeed, and in my humble opinion, one does absolutely and yes without question need to read and approach as an epic and to equally realise and understand that because it has been written by J.R.R. Tolkien like and as the latter (like and as an epic) it is for the most part very (if not even almost one hundred percent) plot driven with an abundance of specific physical (and yes sometimes very much minute) details (about Middle Earth, about both the positives and negatives of Middle Earth, about the threats that are both obviously and insidiously stalking Middle Earth and the many reasons for this) and therefore and definitely with much less of a deliberate emphasis on getting into the internal workings of the multitude of characters presented and depicted/described by Tolkien (by the author) within the pages of his . And no, I am not in any manner saying or claiming that the characters of are somehow unimportant or lesser, but simply and yes indeed, that like with the epical narrarives and stories of Antiquity and the Middle Ages, the tale of the threat of The Ring of Power, of Sauron's reawakening and restrengthening and of Frodo, Samwise, Gandalf, Aragon, Legolas and the rest of the Fellowship setting out on their quest to take the one ring back to Mordor to be destroyed in the volcanic fires of Mount Doom is much, is considerably more essential and necessary knowledge and information than detailed analyses of character and having the latter with nuance and psychology developed at the potential detriment to plot and storylines.\n\nBut furthermore, I also do very much and personally understand and appreciate that for some readers the vast amount of writing (and especially the myriad of inserted song like poems) can have the tendency to make potentially or even actually much daunting and off-putting. However, I also do have to say and claim that I have actually only one time (and this the very first time I tackled LOTR in its entirety at the age of about twenty-five) read ALL of the poems (as well as the myriad of foot and endnotes) that are part of and that whenever I do reread LOTR, while I always read slowly, deliberately and with appreciation of and for Tolkien's eye for detail and description, I also tend to skim and skip a goodly number of the inserted songs (but always do read and even sing my personal favourites such as the song of the merry old inn and the beautiful but heartbreaking lament for Boromir) and yes those parts of in particular section that I for one always find tedious and dragging (mostly when Frodo and Samwise are trudging through the marshes with Gollum, simply because I just happen to find the story threads that feature Aragon, Legolas and Gimli considerably more interesting, engaging and even sometimes a bit humorous). And while some LOTR completists and fundamentalists might well find my way of reading anathema and problematic (and perhaps even an insult to J.R.R. Tolkien's work and legacy), for me, coming to selectively and occasionally if not even often skimming (and skipping) those parts that I am finding (and have always found) a bit tedious and dragging, this has also made me enjoy and appreciate Tolkien's oeuvre all the more and all the more lastingly (with me not only ranking with five stars but also always being both willing to reread and indeed very much looking forward to rereading ever two to three years).\nShow more",

            "content": "I became horrifically lazy towards the end of the LOTR re-read which was undertaken as part of my \"month of the kitten squisher\" and neglected to review the final two books which together make up The Return of the King. Not so much resting on my laurels as stretching out full length and having a big old snooze right on top of them. But you've all seen the film by now right? So no need to continue...\n\nKidding, kidding.\n(and I've now put this review in the correct order so the newest bits are at the bottom)\n\n\n\nFour hobbits, two men, one elf, one dwarf and a wizard. This would be the best line up ever for a reality television show.\n\nFrodo, Merry, Pip and Sam along with Aragorn, Boromir, Legolas, Gimli and Gandalf are the interspecies representatives that form the Fellowship of the Ring. A sort of United Nations of Middle Earth if you will, where the collective are supposed to protect and defend the freedom of all who dwell in Middle Earth and who are at threat from the growing darkness which is gradually creeping out of Mordor.\n\nThere is no denying that this collection of six books (now widely published and referred to as a Trilogy) is an epic work. Tolkien sets out his stall early on in Book One with detailed descriptions, dense prose, background histories,poetry and a whole new language. There is a lot of word furniture but given the scope of the story and size of the metaphorical room, it needs to be heavily furnished in order to make it seem real or else hobbits, elves, dwarves and men would be tramping around in a cavernously empty room. Tolkien will not be rushed. He has an end game but with five more books to get through there is no point in putting all your Hobbits in one hole. The first book is slow paced and littered with mythology, poetry and song so if you were bracing yourself for a breathless dash from Hobbiton to Rivendell then you will be disappointed.\n\nAnd now, a word about the incessant singing. Hobbits like to eat and Hobbits like to sing. The descriptions of eating are fine, although they just made me hungry in turn. The singing is another matter. Much like an episode of Glee, there was far too much impromptu bursting into song and Hobbity jazz hands. You are on a serious mission Hobbits - act accordingly! With that in mind I didn't bother to read about 90% of the singing and so that made the reading of Book One a much speedier endeavour.\n\n\n\nInspired by the hobbity singing - jazz hands optional (and to be sung to Stand by Your Man by Tammy Wynette)\n\nSometimes its hard to be a hobbit\nGiving all your love to just one ring\nYou'll have bad times\nAnd Saruman will have good times\nDoing evil things that you don't understand\n\nBut with the Fellowship you'll defeat him\nEven though he's hard to understand\nAnd though you fear him\nAnd are wary of him\nYou can beat him\nCause after all he's just a (Saru)man\nStand by your Sam (Wise Gamgee of the Shire)\nGive him two arms to cling to\nAnd a ring to bring too\n\nWhen nights are cold and lonely\nAnd you sleep by rick or stone or tree\nStand by your Sam\nAnd tell Middle Earth you love him\nKeep giving all the love you can\nStand by your Sam\nStand by your Sam\nAnd show Middle Earth you love him\nKeep giving all the love you can\nStand by your Sam!\n\n\n\nBook three is the book where the hobbity singing, skipping and general happy-go-luckiness stops and war starts. War comes to Middle Earth preceded by the felling of great trees, the scorching of the earth, the poisoning of the waters and the birthing of a new race of fighting Uruk-hai. The eye of Sauron has turned its baleful crimson gaze from the orc-ugly workings of Mordor to the realms of men. If this was not bad enough, Saruman, powerful white wizard and most senior of Gandalf's order has decided that black is the new white and effectively changed teams. Apparently black is so much more timeless and the ultimate LBR (little black robe) is something that even wizards desire.\n\nBut this book is not just the vehicle in which the hobbits travel to war... this is the book in which we are introduced to a whole host of new characters and LOTR species. Further detailed descriptions of the history and linguistic roots of both Ents and Elves are forthcoming. An even more refined version of the previous word furniture (think Louis XIVth not Ikea)is placed at strategic points around the room adding a further comfortable dimension to Middle Earth. It is this constant growth and development which, although fantastical has its routes in etymology which makes the fantasy world of Lord of the Rings much more acceptable, perhaps even believable than previous fantasy epics.\n\n\n\nDespite not believing that Hobbits would be very useful in a battle field scenario, Merry and Pippin prove their metal and generally kick Isengard butt in the final instalment of The Two Towers. Admittedly having some giant walking trees to ride around in makes them seem a good deal more invincible but generally you have to give them kudos for having disproportionately large balls, and not the scrying kind either.\n\nIsengard stands barren and torn asunder and Saruman is a prisoner in his own tower while the people of Rohan have made their stand against the fighting Uruk-hai at Helms Deep proving what most great generals already knew. It's not the number of men (or elves or dwarves) you have at your disposal, but how you deploy them that counts. Frodo and Sam are still toiling onwards with the fretful gollum at their heels. It was here that I began to get a little confused as the time scale is disproportionately short in relation to the number of pages employed in order to make the journey thus far. In fact it has taken me longer to read the book than it did for the whole journey to take place and I am no slouch on the page turning front.\n\n\n\nSo now the Fellowship is well and truly torn asunder and even all the squeaking hobbits have been effectively separated, albeit it for a short while. The funny thing about hobbits is that the less of them there are in close proximity to each other, the less annoying I find them. Book Five sees Middle Earth fighting wars on many fronts. Denethor is fighting his own inner battles as well as looking towards Mordor and wondering what the hell is about to be spewed forth into his realm, The Battle for the Hornburg is over but Rohan still have to make a stand against the Witch King of Agmar. He is taken care of utilising at bit of Tolkien-style \"girl power\" in the form of Eowyn who rides into battle and takes one of the hobbits along for ballast. Faramir meanwhile discovers there are many downsides to being an only son. Gandalf and Aragorn decide to play knock knock ginger at the Black Gate in the hopes that this will allow Sam and Frodo to nip in the back door.\n\n\n\nOn the way to the top of Mount Doom, Shelob spins Frodo a yarn and leaves Sam carrying the one ring. Cheerfully the orcs are easily distracted by a nice bit of shiny, much like my good self and Sam rescues Frodo and returns the burdensome trinket to him. After this the journey continues with a very long trek to the Crack of Doom (imagine the worst Duke of Edinburgh Gold Award Challenge ever).\n\nDespite having a clear idea of the kind of trouble the ring is capable of getting everyone into (1000 pages has got to be long enough to get a clue), Frodo still battles with the idea of chucking it into the firy pit. Cheerfully Gollum steps up and takes care of this for him but not before taking a finger-snack for good measure. Beyond Mordor, Aragorn is crowned king and everyone is soppy as the inevitable man/elf love story reaches its final climax with graceful smiles and sheepish looks (in the film anyway).\n\nBack home in Hobbiton, not all has gone to plan and the shire is a shadow of its former self. Evil has also pervaded the shire but now that Bag Ends best known hobbit-warriors have returned it won't be there for long, oh no. Evil is expelled, Saruman is slain and Sam gets the girl.\nThen there is a lot of happily ever afters, just like it should be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more",

            "content": "In my head, the purpose of this review is very clear. It is to convince YOU to read this book. Yes, you! Waste time no more. Go grab a copy.\n\nMachiavellian intrigue, mythology, religion, politics, imperialism, environmentalism, the nature of power. All this set in a mind-boggling, frighteningly original world which Herbert ominously terms as an \"effort at prediction\". Dune had me hooked!\n\n\n\nThe very first stirring I felt upon opening the yellowed pages of Dune was that of stumbling upon an English translation of an ancient manuscript of undeniable power and potence which had an epic story to narrate. The tone was umistakably sombre and I realized Herbert was not here to merely entertain me, he was here to make me part of the legend of . It was intriguing and challenging and heck, since I live for challenges I decided to take this one up too, gladly. The challenge was the complexity and depth of the plot, which left me perplexed, in the beginning. I knew there were dialogues which meant much more than their superficial meaning and was unable to grasp at it. I felt a yawning chasm between Herbert's vision and my limited understanding of it. However, of course, I plodded on and could feel the gap closing in with every page much to my joy and relief.\n\n\n\n\"To the people whose labours go beyond ideas into the realm of 'real materials'- to the dry-land ecologists, wherever they may be, in whatever time they work, this is dedicated in humility and admiration.\"\n\nThe foreword makes it pretty clear that Frank Herbert isn't kidding around. This is a serious effort at predicting how our world is going to look two thousand years from now and by God, it's a bloody good and detailed prediction. However, the real merit in this effort lies in the commentary on our lives in the present.\n\n\n\nThe setting of the book is arid futuristic. the plot is driven by political mind games reminiscent of The Game of Thrones. The issues he tackles are as modern as the colour television. Herbert's genius manifests itself in his ability to combine the past, the present and the future in one sweeping elegant move called Dune.\n\n\n\nDune is set in a futuristic technologically advanced world which after the (the bloody war between Man and Machines) has eliminated all computers and passed a decree declaring . Since there are no computers, the essential working of the galaxy is still and with heavy reliance on men and their dallying around. Lots of thriller potential right there. Men with superhuman analytical abilities called have taken the place of Computers. On the other hand, we have the , an ancient school of mental and physical training for female students (it gives them superhuman intuitive powers) who follow a selective breeding program which makes them feared and mistrusted through the Imperium. Their desired end product of this breeding program is the , a superman who ll be able to glimpse into the future. How he ll be able to do this is rooted in Herbert s idea of determinism: given that one can observe everything and analyze everything, one can effectively glimpse the future in probabilistic terms. Quantum physics anyone? The is the proposed solution to the male-female dichotomy, between the analytical and intuitive.\n\nThe plot of Dune is almost wholly set on the desert planet of (also referred to as Dune), an arid wasteland where water is so scarce that men have to wear stillsuits which recycle human moisture for further consumption. The source of the galaxy s interest in the planet is , a spice which bestows upon one longevity and prescient powers. Everything on the planet is permeated with the spice, the air, the sand, the food. Everybody on the planet is hopelessly addicted to the spice, their only hope for survival being their continued intake of the spice. The , the economic and trading monopolistic arm of the Galaxy badly needs the spice for interstellar transport. This is because their frigates travel faster than the speed of light and hence travel backward in time. The spice is the only way they can look into the future and see their way ahead. How cool is that! All the powers on the Galaxy are out to mine the spice, braving the sandworms, their name merely an euphemism, for they are gigantic 200 metre long creatures which always come digging through the sand whenever spice mining is undertook. . There s also another little glitch. There exist on the planet, the kickass native desert tribal , whom the foreign powers look down with suspicion and disdain. The ethos is one of survival and scarcity, driven by tribalism and egalitarianism. Okay, I ll stop right there. No more spoilers about this. Except that they value water to the extent that spitting on a person is the highest honour they can bestow upon him.\n\nOur protagonists are the family, consisting of the Duke, his Bene Gesserit concubine Jessica and their son Paul, who have been entrusted the stewardship of Arrakis. We discover the alien planet of Arrakis along with them, firstly with fear, suspicion and wonder and ultimately, love and respect. , however is no ordinary prince. There s a teeny weeny chance he might be the , something which troubles him constantly and gives us our conflicted hero. The poor chap over the spice and has visions of black hordes pillaging and murdering around town bearing his flag and sees his dead body multiple times.\n\nMy favourite character, however has to be the , the most evil character I ve ever come across in my literary excursions. He is ruddy ruthlessness, he is virile villainy, he is truculent treachery. He executes the inept chess players in his employ which says oodles about his badassery and his fondness for cold-blooded logic. He sees everything in simplistic terms. What is my best move? What is my opponent s best move? Is there anything I can do to completely squash his move? Is there a tactic which leads to mate in three?\n\n\n\nIn this setting, Herbert does so much, it s unbelievable. Religion, politics, the dynamic nature of power, the effects of colonialism, our blatant destruction of our environment are themes which run parallel to the intensely exciting and labyrinthine plot. He shows the paramount importance of myth making and religion for power to sustain over long periods of time.\n\n\n\nNow these are my thoughts about what Herbert could have meant to be Arrakis-\n\n\n\nIt makes perfect sense. Herbert draws heavy inspiration for the religious ideology of Muad Dib from Islam. He says  When religion and politics ride in the same cart and that cart is driven by a living Holy man, nothing can stand in the path of such a people.  which is the philosphy of the politics of Islam. Islamism in a nutshell.\n\nThe spice, much desired by everyone, is the oil. Baron Vladmir Harkonnen is symblomatic of the wily Russians. The Desert foxes Fremen are representative of the native Saudi desert-dwelling Bedouin tribe who have a strongly tribe-oriented culture and undoubtedly value water in equal measure. And the ultimate loser is the environment.\n\n\n\nI almost forget this is a science fiction novel, it s that real. It is also scary and prophetic. It is a reading experience that will leave you dreaming of the grave emptiness of Arrakis and make you wish you were there to brave it all in the privileged company of the noble Fremen. Frank Herbert achieves the pinnacle of what a sci-fi author aspires to rise to; authentic world building.\nShow more",

            "content": "Let me start by first apologizing to everyone who loves this classic. I don't doubt Dune was something special when it first came out in the 1960s. But reading it for the first time today, it feels horribly outdated to me and at times almost incomprehensible.\n\nI was warned going into this story that the beginning is extremely hard to understand, but that is an understatement. I could barely follow its scene after scene of dialogue referencing people and places and events, all with no explanation or context. It literally feels like I was just dropped into the middle of a book, and everything had already been explained elsewhere.\n\nBut it gets better, right? Well, only somewhat. A narrative does take shape, but the writing style remains confusing and obscure. It manages to be both long-winded and not clear enough, if you can believe that. Certain obvious points are harped on again and again, but other crucial ones are merely glossed over. Then, when you inevitably miss those important points, they create this cascading effect that keeps you mired in confusion.\n\nThe writing is also pretentious, with regular or nonsensical things consistently being presented in a profound way. There are plenty of extraneous paragraphs that sound good until you try to discern their meaning, at which point you'd be stumped. This sort of writing really confused me because I couldn't figure out which paragraphs mattered and needed to be dissected carefully to suss out their hidden meaning, and which ones are just adornment.\n\nAs for the story itself, it was a complete mismatch with my interests. I like science fiction with lots of real science. Instead, this is a space opera (a.k.a. a soap opera that takes place in space) with no actual science. It's all political intrigue, melodrama, doublespeak, and who has power over who, which I have zero interest in. I also couldn't care less about how fawningly amazing Paul is and how he is destined to be the chosen one.\n\nThis was such a frustrating reading experience because it could've been an amazing story. And there were moments in the beginning when I thought it was going in those creative directions. I was riveted during that infamous test in the first scene, only to realize that it was completely irrelevant to the rest of the story. Or to see where the book could take the scientific aspects of a desert planet and a population with so little water, which it didn't other than a bit of lip service.\n\nBut the book stubbornly chose to disregard these more interesting avenues, and instead took the most straightforward, boring route of making this into a story about power struggle. Well, we could've saved ourselves the bother and just stayed on Earth for that.\nShow more",

            "content": "There's a characteristically witty essay by Borges about a man who rewrites Don Quixote, many centuries after Cervantes. He publishes a novel with the same title, containing the same words in the same order. But, as Borges shows you, the different cultural context means it's a completely new book! What was once trite and commonplace is now daring and new, and vice versa. It just happens to look like Cervantes's masterpiece.\n\nSimilarly, imagine the man who was brave or stupid enough to rewrite in the early 21st century. Like many people who grew up in the 60s and 70s, I read the book in my early teens. What an amazing story! Those kick-ass Fremen! All those cool, weird-sounding names and expressions they use! (They even have a useful glossary in the back). The disgusting, corrupt, slimy Harkonnens - don't you just love to hate them! When former-aristo-turned-desert-guerilla-fighter Paul Muad'Dib rides in on a sandworm at the end to fight the evil Baron and his vicious, cruel nephew, of course you're cheering for him. Who the hell wouldn't be?\n\nSo that was the we know and love, but the man who rewrote it now would get a rather different reception. Oh my God! These Fremen, who obviously speak , live on a desert planet which supplies the Universe with melange, a commodity essential to the Galactic economy, and in particular to transport. a very subtle way to say \"oil\"! They are tough, uncompromising fighters, who are quite happy to use suicide bombing as a tactic. They're led by a charismatic former rich kid (OK, we get who you mean), who inspires them to rise up against the corrupt, degenerate... um, does he mean Westerners? Or only the US? And who Baron Harkonnen intended to be? I'm racking my brains... Dubya doesn't quite seem to fit, but surely he means ? Unless, of course, he's just a generic stereotype who stands for the immoral, sexually obsessed West. This is frightening. What did we do to make Frank al-Herbert hate us so much? You'd have people, not even necessarily right-wingers, appearing on TV to say that the book was dangerous, and should be banned: at the very least, it incites racial hatred, and openly encourages terrorism. But translations would sell brilliantly in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, and a bad movie version would soon be made in Turkey.\n\nI honestly don't think Herbert meant any of that; but today, it's almost impossible not to wonder. If anyone reading this review is planning to rewrite , you'd better make sure you get your timing right. Who knows how it will be interpreted five years from now?\n\nShow more",

            "content": "No one should argue the importance Dune. It laid the foundations for a great deal of the themes and constructs in modern science fiction. Frank Herbert was as important to the genre as Isaac Asimov and Arthur Clarke. Unfortunately, just like them, he's quite dated, and his books can be a labor to read. One thing he maintained from old science fiction was prim and scientific dialogue that no one would ever actually speak. I've known many scientists, and they don't talk like this. You're not going to convince me a child does.\n\nThe stuffy dialogue is inserted into even stuffier narrative, until it feels like nothing is organic about Herbert's prose. This is a terrible tragedy when you've got a world that he put so much effort into building - and it is an amazing feat of world-building, technically interplanetary building. But unlike J.R.R. Tolkien, who he is so frequently compared to, Herbert didn't make sure to include a great story in his world. Instead he included a story that frequently illustrated how clunky an artificial world can be, even if it's lovingly crafted. I struggled to attach or find interest in anyone, yet they're more archetypes than human beings, whose logic races past modern skepticism and whose dialogue is cloyingly artificial, the way people cared for the Hobbits, Dwarves and Rangers. In his world-building, Tolkien at least saved himself from being dated by antedating himself, and even with his illuminated prose, wrought more characteristics in just one protagonist than all of 's cast.\n\nEven the political intrigue Herbert tries to fall back on was overdone in the Spy genre decades before he started this book. All fans of the \"Genre\" genres should appreciate Herbert's massive contributions, but they shouldn't pretend to enjoy the books if they don't, and they should be wary of certain pitfalls typical of science fiction that survived into his landmark work.\nShow more",

First, the book is incredibly put together and really well thought out. Often, the author wrote the book in such a way as you can hear the character's thoughts which was a really interesting perspective and provided a more immersive experience.\n\nThe book touches on so many different deep topics and is so inspiring, moving.

            "content": "Dune.\n\nNo other single syllable means as much to the science fiction genre, a single word that conjures images of sandworms, spice wars, great battles between rival dynastic families and a massively detailed and intricately crafted universe. No wonder this is widely regarded as not just a Science Fiction masterpiece, but a literary achievement as well.\n\nLike a study of Shakespeare, the reader finds that this is an archetype upon which many influences and imitators have based their works. The complexity and depth of the creation is staggering and I am continually astounded at the discipline with which Herbert must have focused his imagination.\n\nThis is the book upon which Herbert would base his greatest series and one that would outlive him as his son has continued to expand and add detail to the vast, immaculate tapestry woven by a true master of the genre. Encapsulating political, economic, sociological, biological, cultural and dynastic themes, Frank Herbert has set a high standard for later practitioners.\n\nBrilliant.\n\n***2015 reread - Read years later, this has lost none of its narrative power, if anything I can better appreciate the virtuoso attention to detail Herbert exhibited in his epic creation. From the perspective of having read his later 5 Dune sequels, I am astounded at the rich tapestry he has woven. Most impressive was his close omnipresence, analyzing the thoughts and minute actions and subtle nuances of his complicated dynamic interplay of characters. The exhaustive training of the Bene Gesserit and the intricate relations of the Houses and the Guild would stand as a monumental benchmark for speculative fiction ever since.\n\nThis time around I found myself looking more closely at the Harkonnens and will likely read some of Brian Herbert's additions to his fathers great work.\n\n***2019 reread - I'm even more in love with this book and am again in awe of Herbert's narrative skill. This time around I noticed that all of the quotes that begin chapters are from Princess Irulan and I paid close attention to how Herbert crafted these interludes.\n\nI also was drawn to the religious undertones that really began very early in the book and how Paul realized his gifts and was preparing for his role in the beginning chapters - all demonstrating Herbert's great narrative skill.\n\nFinally, I became more aware of what a great character was Gurney Halleck. While the ghola of Duncan Idaho dominated the later books, Herbert's creation of Halleck was an enjoyable and thought provoking addition to this masterpiece.\n\nShow more",

Sure, it might be a bit too soon for her, but she DID insist because we'll be seeing Dune part 2 later this year. And she happens to know that I'm a rabid uberfan with no mercy or remorse.\n\nPLUS, I was able to read from my gorgeous new hardcover copy gifted to me by my best friend and that really does make all the difference, no?\nds\n\nUpdate 9/15/21\n\nRe-read. Number 14.\n\nI cannot get over how beautiful this book is. Still my favorite after all these years. It only gets better with every re-read.\n\n\nUpdate 8/28/17\n\nRe-read. Number 13. :) I cry when Paul meets Gurney. I shiver when Jessica consoles Chani. I'm awestruck by the peaks and troughs of time, free-will, and the weakness in Paul even as he heroically strives against the evil that is about to be unleashed upon the universe.\n\n*sigh*\n\nPerfection. Easily the number one book I've ever read. :)\n\nI waver, sometimes, but right now, it is my absolute favorite. :)\n\n\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nThis is a phenomenal classic of literature.\n\nIt's not just science fiction. It transcends science fiction, as a fascinating discussion of free-will versus inevitability. Can the Jihad be denied? Can Paul ever really avoid his own death, despite seeing every time-line play out with him as the butt of every cosmic joke? Can even cruelty or mercy even remain comprehensible after such knowledge?\n\nYes, I think this work outdoes Nietzsche. It certainly does a great job of making us care about the question.\n\nIs this all? Is this just a work that pays great justice to philosophy of action and inaction?\n\nOr is the novel merely a clever play at turning the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle into the physical embodiment of a man? It is that, of course. The Kwisatz Haderach can be many places at once, and he can be both alive and dead at the same time just like that certain cat.\n\nIs the novel a coming of age tale, first set as a mirror against his father Leto, only then to mirror the whole universe that had just turned against him? Yes, of course. He was, after all, both the product of all his upbringing and his genes, embodying the question of nature versus nurture. He was taught within many schools of martial arts and assassins, as well as training the mind in both the schools of the Mentats with their pure logic and that of the mystics, the Bene Gesserit, that allows complete control over the body down to the cellular level. And if this training wasn't enough, he was deeply schooled in politics, leadership, and the meaning of loyalty. The boy was raised right. Of course, that is nothing without ninety generations of genetic bloodline tampering from the Bene Gesserit, right? To become the fulcrum between cellular memory, tapping the minds and lives of all your genetic ancestors as well as tapping the ability to fold time and space, to become the eye of a storm of time.\n\nWhat a damn brilliant setup for one tiny character, no? His training links to the unlocking of his genes and to the life-extending and enveloping spice, Melange, to make him not merely aware of time in a theoretical sense, but eventually to be unable to discern what was in the past, the present, or the future. Here's a true Super-Man, well beyond Nietzsche.\n\nAnd don't believe for one second that this serious discussion about what would make a superior man makes for dull reading. No. We've got PLOT that's probably some of the most exciting and visceral in all of literature, driving us right into the web of intrigue, vengeance, treachery, and galactic politics.\n\nTo quote the text, we've got \"Plans within Plans,\" and it hardly stops there. We know the House Atreides is falling into a trap laid by the Emperor and House Harkonnen, and yet free-will and pride prevents any chance to avoid it. The setup is brilliant and extremely political, giving us character sketches of some of the most brilliant and memorable characters of all time.\n\nDuke Leto, the Red Duke, the most honorable and beloved leader.\nDuncan Idaho, the emotional and intuitive hero.\nGurney Halleck, archetypal loyalist and troubadour.\nLady Jessica, the woman who ought to have had all honor in life, but was unjustly reviled and set aside for political necessity. (Chani being both her mirror and her eventual glory.)\n\nAnd of course, my favorite character of all time, Paul Muad'dib Atreides, the one that would prevent the greater evils he foresaw, and went to enormous lengths and sacrifice to achieve, but who eventually failed in his task because even a god cannot overcome destiny. (Or the will of so many minds set as one.)\n\nSo damn brilliant.\n\nFrank Herbert spent five years writing this treasure, working and reworking it until he published it at age 25. None of his other works come close to this masterpiece, and there's little wonder. It was birthed, fully-formed, like Athena from Zeus's head, with enormous forethought and care.\n\nThe worldbuilding was just as carefully formed, from the ecology of Arrakis and the life-cycles of the sandworms, to the history and the creation of the Fremen from their mild beginnings as Zensunni Wanderers, adherents to the Orange Catholic Bible, to their history of oppression so like those of those who are Jewish, to their settling and hardening of their bodies and souls in the wastes of Arrakis, also just like the Jewish who carved out a place for themselves in Israel. (Current politics aside, this was a very potent idea before 1965 when Herbert wrote this, and indeed, the core is still just as powerful when you turn it back to Muslims.)\n\nThe Galactic culture is rich and detailed. The CHOAM economic consortium, with their monopoly on space travel and their need for the Spice to allow them to see a short period into the future to plot a safe course before folding space. The Empire is caught on a knife's edge between a single power and every other House who sit in the possibility of putting aside all their squabbles for the sole purpose of checking the Emperor, if they so desired. (And Duke Atreides was such a possible popular leader among all the Great Houses, which was the primary reason the Emperor wanted him dead.)\n\nAnd of course, we have our Villains.\n\nThe Baron Harkonnen has always been a crowd pleaser. Brilliant in his own right, devious and able to corrupt anyone with just the right sorts of pressure, including a certain absolutely trustworthy doctor we might mention.\n\n\"The Tooth! The Tooth!\" -- You can't handle the Tooth!\n\nFeyd Rautha Harkonnen is especially interesting for the question of nature versus nurture.\n\nThe Bene Gesserit had intended him to mate with Paul, who should have been Leto and Jessica's daughter, and that offspring should have been the cumulation of ninety years of a breeding experiment to recreate the Kwisatz Haderach which had come about almost by accident during the Butlerian Jihad in the deep past, to overthrow the AI overlords.\n\nHe was practically Paul's genetic twin, or at least, his potential to be the \"One who can be many places at once\" was on par with Paul. But instead of fulfilling the kind of destiny that we get with Paul, we see him grow up under the auspices of his Uncle the Baron, becoming as cruel and devious as he was deadly. He was the argument of nurture in the conversation, of course, and having so very little of it eventually cost him his life.\n\nI often wonder about the directions that Dune could have taken, all those little paths in time and circumstance that could have been. What if Feyd had been brought to Arrakis earlier and overwhelmed with Spice the way that Paul had? Sure, he wouldn't have been able to convert the unconscious changes into conscious manipulation, but he might have had enough glimpses of the future, the way that the Fremen did, to have given him the edge he would have needed to kill Paul.\n\nAnd then there's a relatively minor character, Hasimir Fenring, the Emperor's personal assassin, who was nearly the Kwisatz Haderach, himself. Unable to breed true, he was still potent enough to be completely hidden to Paul's time-sight in the same way that Paul was hidden from the Spacing Guild's weaker time-sight. His training as a skilled killer was also superior to Paul. He was, by all the hints and tricks in the tale, Paul's perfect downfall. It always gives me shivers to think about, and it was only in a single instant of both recognition and pity from Paul that stayed Fenring from killing our hero. It was just a moment of whim.\n\nThe setup was gorgeous. Paul's pity, had it been missing at his moment of greatest triumph over the Emperor, would have meant Paul's assured death. I still wonder, to this day, what stayed Frank Herbert's hand from killing his most wonderful darling. We knew the pressure of religion and politics was going to have its way upon all the oppressed peoples of Dune. The return of a monstrous religious Jihad was going to happen one way or another, sweeping across the galaxy and toppling the Empire, regardless of Paul's frantic plans and desires. Paul's own death would only mean a higher level of fanaticism, and Frank Herbert's warning against unreasoning devotion would have been made even clearer with Paul's death.\n\nPerhaps it was pity that stayed his hand. Who are we to say who lives and who dies?\n\nIf you really think this review is overlong, then I apologize, but please understand that I could absolutely go on and on much longer than this. It is a symptom of my devotion to this most brilliant of all tales.\n\nAnd yes, it still holds up very, very well after twelve reads. I am quite shocked and amazed.\nShow more",

            "content": "People often forget that this series is what innovated our modern concept of science fiction (up until Neuromancer and The Martix, at least). Dune took the Space Opera and asked if it might be more than spandex, dildo-shaped rockets, and scantily-clad green women. Herbert created a vast and complex system of ancient spatial politics and peoples, then set them at one another's throats over land, money, and drugs.\n\nDune is often said to relate to Sci Fi in the same way that Tolkien relates to Fantasy. I'd say that, as far as paradigm shift, this is widely true. Both entered genres generally filled with the odd, childish, and ridiculous and injected a literary sensibility which affected all subsequent authors.\n\nFew will challenge the importance of Star Wars' effect on film and storytelling in general, but without Dune, there would be no Star Wars. Princess Alia, the desert planet, the Spice, the Bene Gesserit, and Leto II all have direct descendants in the movies. It is unfortunate that Lucas seems to have forgotten in these later years that his best genius was pilfered from Herbert, Campbell, and Kurosawa.\n\nThough I have heard that the later books do not capture the same eclectic energy as the first, Dune itself is simply one of the most original and unusual pieces of Sci Fi ever written. Read it, Starship Troopers, Ringworld, Neuromancer, and Snowcrash and you'll know everything you need to about Sci Fi: that you want more.\nShow more",

            "content": "2021 Reread - 5*\n\nI was totally blown away by the recent movie version of this, that much so I decided to revisit and revaluate my opinion of this extraordinary book.\n\nSo, I read it again six years on and this is something I said I would never do because I found it so difficult to read the first time. It wasn t the complexity of the world and politics, but the narration style which totally perplexed and frustrated me. Though I think that was more to do with my immaturity as a reader at the time than anything else. This is a difficult one, but it s worth it.\n\nThis time I was impressed with everything: the intelligence of the writing, the details of the world and the intricate nature of the storytelling. There s just so much brilliance here. And it s entertaining. It s interesting. The balance is perfect.\n\nThe Freman culture is driven by ideas of ecology, efficiency and waste reduction. And whilst they are not without their faults, the sense of oneness and appreciation they have for their home planet is a strikingly important commodity. I found them fascinating to read about and of the many thing this novel has going for it, they are the jewel in Herbert s crown.\n\nI want to see more of this world.\n\n\n\nI could never give Dune five stars because I really struggled to get into the novel in the beginning. It has taken me almost two months to read. This, for me, is a very long time to spend on a book. It took me so long to read because I found the writing style incredibly frustrating. I had to read whole chapters again so I could get the gist of the plot. This was more so in the beginning, which I found particularly hard to read because of the author s way of shifting between the thoughts of multiple characters. I found this very annoying; however, I persevered over my initial despondency towards the writing, and plodded on through the book. I m glad I did so because in the end I did come to really enjoy it. Indeed, the story is fantastic, but the writing will always remain unbearable for me.\n\n\n\n\n\nis to science fiction what is to high fantasy; it is the novel that officially, and unarguably, defines the genre. The story begins with the house of Atreides accepting the Dukedom of the planet Dune. The former Baron has been ousted by the Emperor, and is no longer of consequence. Well, that is how it initially appears. Very early on it revealed that the whole thing is a political ploy to bring the house of Atreides to its knees. The Baron lies in wait, and is ready to strike against the new, and benevolent, approach the Duke uses on the Fremen.\n\nThe Fremen are the natives of the dessert planet; thus, they know how to survive its harshness above all others. They do this through their frugal approach to water. They value it above all else, and will never waste a drop in earnest. The Baron Harkonnen, as a chide against the natives, squanders water in the cruellest ways. He, and his dinner guests, throw cups of water on the floor of the dinner hall; it was his tradition. The wasted water was soaked up with towels, which the Baron allowed the Fremen to suck the water out of. When the Duke enters he rejects this custom, and is more respectful to the Fremen way of life. He and his son and heir Paul, who is the protagonist of this novel, go as far as to try the Fremen s grossly effective water saving suits. These Stillsuits, quite literally, recycle all the water the body wastes and feeds it back to its wearer.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis early familiarity, with the Fremen technology, no doubt helps to keep Paul s mind open when he is later forced to live amongst the Fremen. Paul is somewhat of a marvel; he is prophecy s chosen one. When he eventually gains the trust of the Fremen they allow him to choose a Fermen name. He calls himself after their most revered prophet: Muad'Dib. They accept this and follow him as their leader. His inherited title of Duke dictates that he is their lord, but their religion determines their real loyalty. He has to, quite literally, fight for every ounce of their trust. Indeed, it does not come cheap, and will only be given to one who is a member of their people.\n\n\n\nThus, Paul becomes their saviour. Consequently, he receives heaps of character development through this book. He goes form boy to the revered leader of a nation. The Fremen, like Paul, want the evil Baron Harkonnen gone from their planet. They do no want a cruel oppressor who is ignorant to their ways: they want Paul. I think the imagination behind the Fremen culture really is wonderful. They have efficiently adapted to survive their harsh planet. To emphasise this point you need only look at the fact that off-world humans live in fear of the giant Sandworms that infect the planet whereas the Fremen ride them as a coming of age ritual. Indeed, Paul has to ride a worm if the Fremen are to follow him.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result of this is a very complex, and intriguing plot. I found the first third of this book to be very perplexing initially. This is a world we are told about rather than shown at the start. We hear about the Fremen but do not truly understand them till the very end. I was very overwhelmed at the beginning, and in all honesty I do think this novel merits a re-read to further establish my understanding of it. This did affect my rating because it inhibited by enjoyment of the book.\n\n\n\nIndeed, aside from Paul there is a whole host of dynamic, and well rounded, characters. His mother is to be the new revered mother of the Fremen people, which for someone of her age is quite remarkable. There is also the captain of Duke Leto s household guard who is a very deep and honourable individual. As much as I came to like these characters I was still frustrated with the writing of them in the beginning. I found it difficult to read scenes in which up to four characters internal thoughts are portrayed alongside their dialogue. It wasn t always clear who was thinking. I much prefer a narrative that is focalised through one person. Well, at least one person per chapter.\n\n\n\nOverall, I thought the idea behind this novel was utterly fantastic. However, my personal reaction to the writing style limited my overall enjoyment of the book. I do intend to read some of the sequels. However, I do not have any intention of doing so in the near future. Maybe, in a couple of years I will return to the brilliant, and annoyingly written, world of Dune.\n\n__________________________________\n\nYou can connect with me on social media via .\n__________________________________\nShow more",

            "content": " I have seen a friend become a worshiper, he thought. \nI don t think I actually *enjoyed* this book. But I certainly respected the hell out of it. For a bit I thought I had it all figured out, pegged it as your bog-standard Chosen One story, and then it went where I didn t think it d go and neatly subverted my expectations. It tackled stuff that is uncomfortable and therefore is generally handwaved over in the usual SF epics. And for that I seriously respected this dense complex tome.\n\n. We give those leaders tremendous power to lead and decide and determine fates. So many stories rooted in the weight of our species collective history glorify this; so many countries still apparently yearn for powerful visionary leaders that others proclaim to be dictators. So many religions go to wars over the legacy left by a popular charismatic leader centuries ago, interpreting those legacies as the engine for the action, destruction, obedience.\n\nHero worship. Messianic worship. Prophecies and tyrannies. Desire for a Savior to rescue you from the evil. Good intentions paving the road to hell.\n\n\n\nThis is a novel of a reluctant Messiah, the journey of a man becoming the Chosen One   but unlike the traditional story of a charismatic savior, . The book ends in an ambiguous place, and I presume the sequels may develop the theme or run away from it and make this a more traditional hero journey. But I certainly hope not. . We love our ideas of ideal benevolent rulers who can set things right, don t we? Or the martyr figures inspiring  righteous  battles? Messiahs and figureheads seem to fulfill the deep-seated cultural longing for an inspirational leader, don t they? .\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, in Frank Herbert hints at the dangers present in such ideas. What seems like your traditional hero s journey turns out darker and more sinister. But it s not the rise of an antihero either. It s subtler than that, without actually being all that subtle.\n\nA son of a planetary Duke (because an interstellar post-technology future is actually feudal) and a highly trained Bene-Gesserit concubine of the Duke\n, Paul fits very well the idea of a Messiah of the tribal resilient society of , neatly fulfilling their religious prophecies\nand possessing genetic superpowers himself, augmented by rigorous training and catalyzed by the ingestion of a magical wonder-drug known as .\n\nBut Paul through his prescient powers can see what his mythologized destiny leads to. And there is not a way to escape it, once your life fits the mysticism of their faith (even if the faith and prophecies were stealthily prereplanted for sort of a similar purpose). Religious fanatics are destined to wage a brutal war that the Messiah is unable to stop.\n\n\n\nAll this is gently hinted at, laid out in the framework of the appealing Hero s journey. It seems that should you desire, you can still easily choose to read it as a typical hero s/antihero s story, just less idealistic than it could be. But that would be Star Wars and not .\n\n\n\nAnd you also can t help but be mesmerized by a harsh desiccated planet where life is focused on survival, where not even water but mere moisture is the most coveted and rarest thing, where hopes for a better, wetter, greener future quietly flourish, tied into messianic ideas but grounded in science. The place of nightmares, written vividly and skillfully, making me want to gulp down a gallon of drink just because I can,\n\nThe world is harsh, unforgiving, brutal, hostile. The characters - well, mostly Paul, but to an extent his mother Jessica as well - are cold, calculating, composed and often very unsympathetic. Paul s father values lives over property. Paul s actions, on the other hand, lead to eyebrow-raising among his father s old lieutenants who note the difference in priorities:\n\n\nIt s dense and complex, full of politics, short on actual science fiction but full of ruminations on human nature   and it leaves me feeling that all of this is a beginning of another cycle of violence, just with a new figurehead at the mast. As Terry Pratchett said, . All while sandworms quietly slither under the sand.\n     \n\nOh yeah, there are sandworms, too.\n     \n\nout of respect for Herbert s subversive story that made me think. I m content with the story ending here, with ambiguity and dread for what s to come.\nShow more",

            "content": "Seems as if they might be duned to be addicted to spice, all good old barbarians on magic mushrooms style.\n\nQuite dusty, especially regarding how to put the different parts of this behemoth series in the big picture of sci-fi because each part (of the 3 I ve read so far and very probably won t restart trying to read the 4th and 5th part) presents something different. Essentially, only this, the first one, is a real science fantasy epos, while the others are mostly circulating around the characters' special skills and family problems without much meta, plot, or different settings.\n\nJust this first milestone is big in the epic worldbuilding department and some other things I ll try to point my primate fingers at. As unrealistic as water scarcity in such a highly developed galactic civilization seems, it s a perfect explanation for creating the blue eyed mind mutants and the misandrist female breeding gang, that don t ever need to kick male butts, because they preemptively avoid that situation to become real.\n\nReal life implications and innuendos.\nI don t know if Herbert had any kind of real civilizations, cultures, or traditions in mind when he constructed the tribes, today it would probably fall under any kind of politically correct bigoted do gooder codex, but there could lie a ton of creative writing gold in exploring this question of how to implement any past or present movement, society, tradition, faith into different sci-fi subgenres. Because how the traditions, monsters, and badass special moves of the inhabitants influence the planetary and intergalactic trade and travel balance is slowly presented to the reader, while the impact of the wonderful spice expands its glow towards total domination.\n\nDon t take drugs except they make you superhuman\nAs so often, a prescription free pharmaceutical wonder cure can solve all of your problems until corporate interests come and ruin everything by using anything in their armory to get control over the precious resource of psychohistoric psi precognition power. The idea of one substance changing the whole balance of power of the galaxy is big in many sci-fi series and especially terrifying for each arrogant, high tech civilization, because an animal creating impervious shields, an immortality tonic, a mind altering super drug, etc., could enable far weaker, steampunky tribes to destroy them. Classic barbarian hordes on magic mushrooms looting Rome style.\n\nBene Gesserit\nWho says that centuries long, epigenetic, elitist breeding programs have to be completely evil all the time? Except for the poor lovers aroused by the wrong, not arranged partner, stupid Romeo and Juliet syndrome complexes, you have to see the bigger picture and control your hormones and feelings and sacrifice some biochemical illusions to create the  berPsi mentat mentalist mind penetrator. However, it works with less evil too. Together with the spice, this elite mental mind control academy with the aim to finally create the ultimate space JC messiah figure to defecate rainbows, freaking galactic peace, pink unicorns, and gold, is the backbone of the whole trilogy, because impacts of both and the excessive use of it as MacGuffins and Chekhovs plot devices lead to the question:\n\nIs this still really sci-fi or not more a high fantasy thing with some sci-fi elements?\nWell, highly subjectively, yes, Dune is mostly psi fantasy dressed in futuristic clothes with some faith, tech, technobabble (rare), and trade in between, which makes it one of the most outstanding and unusual sci-fi works, I mean fantasy camouflaged as sci-fi. Tricky, one is so indoctrinated to call this thing sci-fi that it took me a reread and absorbing many reviews to realize what s really going on. I m really not sure about this whole thing, I ve read a ton of sci-fi and my alien mind parasite, in a kind of perverted symbiosis with the xenovirus making me look fresher I deliberately bought for this purpose like a tapeworm therapy to lose weight (you don t want to know what this costs on the alien bioweapons black market, the second half of my immortal soul exactly), tells me that there still would a lot of story without the sci-fi elements, while close to nothing would be there after removing fantasy, faith, drugs, and mind penetrating abilities, so, yea. I mean, even the planet itself doesn t really has sci-fi fractions or something, the space around it is kind of empty without many sci-fi parties, cyborgs, aliens, everything substantial seen in close to any big sci-fi series. This leads me to\n\nAn unpopular and possibly controversial opinion\nIt could be that Herbert is, and I am just talking about the sci-fi aspect, a bit overrated or, let s precisely define it, overhyped as a sci-fi author because he is more of a fantasy writer. This couldn t happen in a fantasy world, because parts of the legions of readers of the genre don t want aliens and Clarketech mixed in their magic, not to speak of the suspension of disbelief problem that often comes with sudden future tech elements in fantasy, that s just disgusting. The other way round, as with Dune, is much easier, just put some sci-fi around fantasy and everything just rolls perfectly.\n\nIs terraforming destroying cultural heritage or making inhabitable worlds paradises?\nThe ethical implications of this question are another sci-fi old school vehicle, especially if the terrible acid rain, high gravity, parasite infested, or dirty desert land is the only region where the special, red plotline device can grow and thrive. One could go so far as to ask if there are real life examples on earth, conservation vs corporate environmentalism, greenwashing and stuff (spoiler warning: conservation lost, earth is dying), and how this should be dealt with in decades, centuries, or millennia when we (I hope you are immortal too thanks to alien symbiont virus cooperation like me, if you aren t, poor you, may I infect you? Just 20.000 of whatever your fringe financial system uses as fiat money that will be worthless as soon as natural apocalypse, mutually assured destruction, or alien invasion make it obsolete, and you get the parcel. Shipping not included.) start manipulating weather, geophysics and- chemistry, and climate of other worlds to make it sexy, tropical, tourist friendly paradises at the low cost of exterminating all alien life, but this would be a bit far fetched.\n\nHerberts place in the sci-fi or sci-fa hall of fame.\nThat s tricky, especially because he just couldn t keep delivering after the third part. I ve played around with the fourth and fifth part, but had to abandon it because it escalated to too much unmotivated, philosophical drivel without a real plotline and a place in the big picture of the series, Herbert just didn t manage to hold it all together. What made the first three parts, that they are kind of eccentric, ingenious standalones without the classic space opera series uniting plotline and style, great, kind of destroyed the rest of the series. Because he had no more vision for the meta, high sci fa elements, Herbert lost control over his own creation and just manufactured hearthless shells to sell more books.\n\nBut that doesn t mean that the first three parts aren t milestones of the interdisciplinary genre, exploring it in new ways no one imagined before while reaching Lem-, Clarke-, and Asimov levels of subtle, intelligent dialogues, innuendos, connotations, and character driven development. It s something unique, special, and definitively not for anyone because of its high entry barriers that may annoy some readers, but don t let yourself be easily deterred by that, it s totally worth it once you re in and high as heck and addicted forever to the wonderful, delicious spice melange.\n\nTropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique:\nShow more",

            "content": "Dune is often considered a masterpiece of 20th-century American science fiction. In part, the book owes its reputation to the film adaptation David Lynch directed in the early 1980s (although this movie was, and still is, not considered one of his best). Frank Herbert wrote a novel of epic proportions, in other words, a space opera, with its intergalactic feudal society, its decadent (if not evil) empire and its band of rebels: the book was published some ten years before the first instalment of the Star Wars series. Indeed, along with Asimov s (overrated) stories, it was George Lucas  primary source of inspiration.\n\nOne of the most exciting aspects of Herbert s creation is the multi-cultural world he depicts. Each house (Atreides, Harkonnen, etc.), each planet (Arrakis, Giedi Prime, Caladan...), each group (the Fremen, the Bene Gesserit, the Guild, the Emperor s suite and the Sardaukars) has its specific flavour, its own culture, its language   the comprehensive index at the end of the book is utterly fascinating. For each of these cultures, Herbert borrowed traits from traditions (ancient or contemporary) he knew well in reality, especially from the Middle East. In particular, Paul Atreides / Muad Dib s story among the Fremen is redolent of the historical events around T.E. Lawrence and the Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire. And Paul s crusade on Arrakis is told, as though it were ancient history, in the chronicles at the start of each chapter.\n\nHerbert describes his fictional world and characters in great detail, which contributes to the richness of his narrative, but I found these descriptions somewhat boring and, especially, the middle of the book is a bit dragging for that reason. In my view, the most impressive parts of this novel are the dialogues, where Herbert simultaneously reveals what the characters are saying and thinking. This technique lends a sense of duplicity and scheming to almost every interaction. Everyone is plotting one way or another so that the whole thing ends up being like a great Shakespearean play, with dialogues and asides, tyrants and pretenders. What confirms this impression is not only the theme of the exiled Duke (see , , or ), but also the repeated scenes of fencing duels throughout, with feints and poisoned tips: a clear allusion to the endings of and , for instance.\n\n: A word about Denis Villeneuve s new film adaptation of Herbert s novel (part 1, 2021). Comparisons are odious and obviously wouldn t be to David Lynch s advantage. This is a version for a new generation of fans and an epic movie on par with Peter Jackson s trilogy, in the early 2000s. The settings (filmed in Scandinavia and the Middle East) are breathtaking, and the actors have so much going for them. But what strikes me the most in this new version is the sense that everything is overwhelming and sublime: the massive architecture, the crushing machines, the extreme weather conditions, the earth-shattering landscapes, the thunderous music, the tragic events, the repulsive foes. From the relenting waves of Caladan to the searing and unending skies of Arrakis, everything assumes an oceanic and staggering dimension.\nShow more",

A masterpiece of SF with which I will probably compare all SF books that I ll read in the future. It goes in my favorites shelf.\n\nThis is my 3rd attempt to read Dune and I am really grateful that I did not succeed the first two times I tried as I was too young to understand all the subtleties. I would have probably enjoyed it as a very well written adventure novel but nothing more. That would have been a pity as Dune is so much more than a story about space travel and epic battles between good and evil. It presents complex philosophical ideas, explores ecological issues, cultural identity and differences. Also a major theme is represented by religion and religious leadership.\n\nThe disturbing part about this book, taken in the current political context, (I am not sure if Herbert did it on purpose or not) is how easily the Fremen can be identified with an Arab nation. The spice can be seen as  oil  and the Harkonnens as evil westerners/Russians that are exploiting the natural resources without thinking about the locals and the environment. I saw that others reviewers saw this as well.\nShow more",

            "content": "I blame the movie.\n\nI was an avid but novice fantasy and sci-fi reader in 1984 when David Lynch s Dune rolled out as a big-budget adaptation of the 1965 classic book. It was an artistic and box-office failure with Roger Ebert calling it  a real mess, an incomprehensible, ugly, unstructured, pointless excursion.  Numerous references were made to its excessive length, particularly a tv edition that was over 3 hours long. I never did pick up the classic sci-fi book, assuming the commentary heard about the movie applied to the book. All that changed when I broke my finger and found myself with a lot of extra time on my hands (groan).\n\nBesides,\n\n\n\nDune has a lot of ingredients that don t fit into my preferred stories, yet the gestalt was not only tolerable, but engrossing.\n\nIt begins with the Atreides family preparing to shift their holding from their current home to the planet of Arrakis. The Emperor has given the Atreides the territory and trade on the planet of Arrakis, formerly under control of their enemies, the Harkonnen. The planet Arrakis is hot, arid and generally hostile to life. There is, however, a small population of native, fierce Freman who have managed to build an existence in the desert.\n\n\n\nPaul Atreides is the young heir of the family, and mystical testing reveals he might be the one prophesied.\n\n\n\nPaul undergroes a rapid growth curve, facilitated by his teacher Dr. Yeuh and his father s advisors.\n\n\n\nBut it is in the desert that Paul will discover his strength as well as his new people.\n\n\n\nSeriously, now.\n\nHonestly, I have to wonder how much of this is generational. If Sanderson or Rothfuss wrote this book, two chapters in Dune would have made a whole book, and while detail may have been added, it likely would have made for a book as slow as the movie. I liked the scope of Dune, and that there is a resolution to the initial conflict. It is also interesting that despite the volume of concepts packed in here, with political maneuvers, terraforming, technology, cultural assimilation, and mysticism all playing roles that I didn t find it overwhelming, perhaps because so much is genre-familiar.\n\nOn the downside, it could have perhaps used a bit more transitions, particularly near the end when months at a time are skipped. Writing was solid; nothing really stood out, but it told the story well. There s some vague mysticism that might irritate those who like explanations. It was a bit of an eye-roller to have the chief villain be a fat, gay, sadistic pedophile, but Herbert really isn t thinking outside the trope character box much (it s not enough that he sentences people to death but he has to be physically abhorrent? And gay?). World-building is fun, but standard desert.\n\nOverall, I m glad that I finally took the time to read it and put those old assumptions to rest. I love a good hero.\n\nShow more",

            "content": " Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic. \n\nThe sheer scope and magnitude of this 1965 sci-fi drama is staggering, populated with an extensive cast of characters and a rich universe full of well-rounded lore, intricate politics where every actions is revealed as  plans within plans within plans,  and dynamic cultures all set on a collision course of plot that rightfully earned it a wide readership and canonization as a  Classic  work. I found it lived up to the hype and opened itself up more upon a reread, validating the fond memories I had of it from reading it first as a young teenager smitten with anything sci-fi. This book has zero chill and everything is to extreme and epic levels, including the size of worms. But come for the Bene Gesserits, best part. While there isn t much to say that likely hasn t already been said better, I still want to pause and reflect on some key elements in . This is such a well-crafted book that addresses themes of power, religion, historical records as mythmaking and environmental concerns in a narrative about proxy wars and power struggles that speak just as loudly today as it did about 1960s foreign policy. If you are looking for a book of epic proportions, you can t go wrong with .\n\nThe best part about this book, to me, is the way it is constantly expanding. There is great world-building and a rich lore that recalls my glee first exploring , but what really excites me is the way Herbert reveals it all. The book starts so small a visit to a cottage from an old woman that seems like such a small scale fairy tale on page one and swiftly becomes gargantuan and never stops growing. It leaves you constantly feeling yourself shrink beside a universe always revealing itself as more complex than you had realized. I enjoy the way Herbert only gives you the minimum of what you need to understand and lets it all slowly unfold when necessary.\n\n  \n\nFor newcomers, the basis of the book is that Paul has been quite literally bred to be a messiah and is engulfed in a difficult power struggle over a planet that essentially upholds the interplanetary economy through mining an addictive substance called  spice . You might quickly find yourself thinking of spice as oil and the planet Arrakis as Middle East and Northern Africa (Tor put out a really ), you know, since there was a whole Cold War going on at the time and giving the villain Baron Harkonnen a first name like Vladimir might make you wonder if this is all an elaborate metaphor. The Baron saying    might make you think of the three branches of US government. You get the idea. There are also WWII holdovers present, such as the Sardaukar as an elite fighting force trained on Salusa Secundus to make sure you catch the S.S. reference. That s all very much there, but this book is so much more than a simple sci fi rendition of the Cold War and Herbert definitely wants you to apply these themes to our larger political and religious global interactions.\n\n  \n\nAnother aspect I find fascinating in is the depiction of Paul Atreides in the  chosen one  trope. Paul has reservations, though not due to thinking he doesn t deserve it (dude is royalty anyways, essentially) but because he fears what it will bring. Paul s powers are enhanced through spice and he is able to perceive the future, and in almost every possible scenario he sees nothing but mass war in his name:\n\nThe notion of precognition brings free will into question, particularly when a certain individual appears in visions of the future but dies before it happens. It becomes a universe where individual free wills are all acting upon one another in an attempt to control the narrative of time.\n\nHistory is written by the winners, or so the saying goes, and much of this novel focuses on the way the narrative of time is constructed through the mythologizing of people and events.    Jessica says to Chani, assuring her that her role as the lover to Paul will not be usurped by the princess he marries for the throne. Much of the book shows the dynamics between Paul as the Man and Paul as the myth, with characters like Stilgar recognizing that by being in service to the myth they too will be immortalized in the stories. Narratives become a form or power, and, as I ll discuss soon, can be a form of control.\n\nPerhaps it is because power and control are so central to this novel that it feels so very timeless and just as applicable to 2021 as it did to 1965. In regards to power, leadership also becomes another key theme.    House Atreides Duke Leto says,    a sentiment later echoed with all the same key terms by Baron Harkonnen. The two leaders are set up at the start as foils to each other, each trying to have their grip on Arrakis (there are some strong colonialism themes in this book and it delves into how troubling it is and how even those we might view as the savior turn out to be just another oppressor and colonizer) but their leaderships are defined by Leto s rule through caring for his people while Harkonnen sees everyone as a useful pawn.\n\nHaving recently finished , I could have preferred some more voices in this book looking for better forms of ruling that don t involve exploitation, but that s not what this book is about so I ll move on. What this book really focuses on is the ways power can be maintained, which crops up most in this novel through use of religion.    we read, and the harsh life on Arrakis makes it the perfect setting where indoctrination of religion for the purpose of power can shape a community and unite them. Religion is a form of storytelling, having the people all believe in one shared story with all its myths and promises.    Jessica instructs Paul,    The stronger the shared faith, the more easily a leader can make them do what they need. It also helps that everyone is high as shit all the time.    Kynes's father says:\n\nReligion is being used constantly to shape the people for the purpose of their leaders, even in what seems an admirable purpose of turning desert Arrakis into a green paradise (and without a religious idea of paradise, how can a people who only know dry dirt and hardship even imagine a paradise?).\n\n  \n\nThis latter bit is also extremely key to Dune. The planet itself is practically a character in the novel, much in the ways the landscape is like a character in Westerns. The landscape of Arrakis truly shapes the people there, and we see a contrast between Arrakis and Caladan and how water as a precious resource on Arrakis changes many customs. Such as how spitting at a person is a sign of respect on Arrakis. Changing the environment on Arrakis is an interesting concept because, in order to make it thrive, what would the cost be? Would it disrupt spice, thereby collapsing the galaxy s economy? Can these people ever be free, because doing so would require the complete dismantling of the governmental systems currently ruling?\n\nThere is also something to be said about the harshness of an environment being an ideal place for strenght in unity around a cause to crop up. Le Guin explores this in as well, with the anarchist planet having a similar dry desert vibe as Arrakis and scarcity being a major player in what keeps the people bonded and working together. The Fremen are tough because of their environment, similiarly the Sardaukar are trained in extremely harsh environments as well. plays a lot with ideas on how fascism and strongmen can quickly rise to power in times of economic instability or the threat of it and here the difficult planets tend to produce the most deadly fighters. Mix religion in and you have an instant army if you can convince everyone you are the chosen one.\n\nThere is so much more to discuss in this book, particularly the Bene Gesserits and the Guild who are pulling a lot of strings, or just how friggen awesome the worms are. This is a big book with a lot of big ideas, and also a lot of ambiguity to them that I really appreciate. It is certainly a precursor for a lot of popular epics to follow. George Lucas certainly took notes and I imagine read this and said  wait, you can just beloved characters that easily!?  before rewriting Duke Leto as Ned Stark. While I can concede to those who find it boring and dry, I rather enjoyed all the history and lore and found this to be incredibly fun.\n\nShow more",

            "content": "Why You Should Read Dune (video): https://youtu.be/oOomSvGXfaM\n\nAsking me to describe why Dune is so important to me is like asking a child to explain nuclear fusion. I do my best in the video linked above, but just know it probably isn't for the reasons you think.\n\nMy journey to Dune becoming my absolute favorite book of all time goes all the way back to the mid-1990's upon finding it in my high school library and deciding to give it a try because I remembered my dad and brother watching the movie when I was a kid. At 15 years old, I got to the middle of \"book II\" and gave it a big fat DNF. I decided it just wasn't for me. At 17, for the 30th anniversary, I decided to try again and while I finished it that time, I thought the ideas were overly pretentious and way too out there. But a year went by and somehow, it was still in my head. I thought about it frequently and I began to ponder...did I actually really like it?\n\nI tried again the final weeks of my senior year of high school and became absolutely obsessed and it has stayed that way for almost the last 25 years.\n\nDune is social science-fiction in that it's more concerned with the people and society than it is with hard science. Besides telling you that these navigators \"fold space\" for interstellar travel, Herbert doesn't bog you down with the math. He focuses more on the politics, cultures, religion, and philosophies of a world rich in the most valuable resource in the known universe, but barren in everything else.\n\nIf you go into the story expecting a Star Wars style adventure, you're going to leave disappointed. Dune is extremely thought provoking and deals with the struggles of coming of age while the fate of the universe is on your shoulders.\n\nI'll also say that the book is certainly not for everyone. If you love things like ASOIAF and The Wheel of Time, there is no way this book won't be for you as both of those series borrowed heavily from the story Frank crafted. But I think it truly depends on where you are at in your life. Look, I just told you the story of how it took until my third reading for this to really click with me. Those who the story and lessons click with, it REALLY clicks with. But, again, this isn't a crowd pleaser and not everyone is going to love it, especially modern readers. So while I encourage those that are interested to read it, I expect more modern readers to not like it than like it.\n\nNot only is this the greatest science-fiction story of all time, but I believe it should be on mandatory reading lists in schools and everyone interested in the genre owe it to themselves to read the pillar of the genre they have come to love. Dune is every bit to science-fiction what Lord of the Rings is to fantasy.\nShow more",

            "content": "[UPDATED]\nI reread Dune for the first time in several decades and immensely enjoyed it. I also went back to watch the original cult feature film by David Lynch and had quite mixed feelings - while it was close to the overall aesthetic that Frank Herbert describes with the gorgeous desert sets and the terrifying worms, the parts of the story that were necessarily culled out was disturbing (that and the woeful special effects at the time trying (and IMHO failing) to visualize the personal shields that the characters wear in hand-to-hand combat).\n\nFor those who are just discovering Dune for the first time, it is essentially a messianic story on a desert planet (think of Jesus or perhaps Mohammed on Tatooine) in a universe dominated by a cartel (the Guild also known as CHOAM) with a monopoly on a drug (called m lange) derived from a rare material (spice) available only on the desert planet Arrakis (Dune). This drug is so powerful that it allows the Guild (and later Maud'dib) to leverage space-time singularities to defy the speed of light and travel anywhere in the universe. Overlaid on this foundation, the epic battle of the feudal houses of the noble Atreides and the evil Harkkonen houses rages, the betrayal of the former by the latter explicitly endorsed by the Emperor (himself an almost impuissant pawn of the Guild as well). All that to say that the fabric of the story is multilayered and as complex and complete a universe as you will find in George RR Martin or Dan Simmons.\n\nThere are several enhanced human species running around: the Mentats who have been cerebrally enhanced to be able to calculate like supercomputers (computers themselves having been banned!) and each then uses their predictive analytics for their assigned Dukes (or the Emperor) and the Bene Gesserit cult who are a sort of quasi-religious non-celibate nuns who have honed perception and language to the point of having developed nearly superpower-level strengths of persuasion which are almost universally feared and vilified as sorcery in the rest of the universe. Paul Atreides, heir to the throne, is born to Jessica, a Bene Gesserit, possessed some of these powers and when the family moves to Arrakis (part of the aforementioned Harkkonen plot) from their home planet Caladon, he appears to the native Freeman population as perhaps a fulfillment of their messianic prophecies and hopes.\n\nIn perhaps the most critical departure from the book, the Lynch movie does not really show Paul questioning the awesome power that he possesses and his assumption of the mantle as the Arrakis Messiah, the Maud'dib (something that the 2021 film by Denis Villeneuve does thankfully address). In the book, one aspect that I loved was how Paul struggled with this messianic destiny and did everything he could to subvert it. One of the unique gifts he received, presumably as the rare and unique offspring of a Bene Gesserit, was the ability to see possible outcomes (like a Mentat) and thus he could take decisions based on the most likely foreseen outcome. It made for great reading.\n\nThe other great thing about Dune is the aesthetic of this desert planet with impossibly huge worms under the surface who are mysteriously connected to spice and pose a danger to all creatures in the desert except for the Freeman. The still suit which recycles body water in the deep desert was brilliant as was the ever-present obsession with \"water debt\" of the Freemen. I really felt like I was walking unevenly (must not attract the worms!) through the sand with Jessica and Paul before their fateful encounter with the Freemen.\n\nDune is a well-deserved classic for all the reasons I mentioned above and probably much more that I missed. I have read it twice and gotten almost entirely different things out of it each time. I have since read all the canonical Frank Herbert books in the series and enjoyed it all immensely.\n\n[UPDATE] I am looking forward to Denis Villeneuve's Dune in October 2021. The previews I have seen so far seem to be quite coherent with respect to the book. I was a fan of Lynch's Dune and am curious to see what Villeneuve does with this one. Feel free to comment below.\n[UPDATE] Villeneuve s 2021 film covers half of the book and does a fantastic job as both an homage to Herbert s book and Lynch s film. The casting, costumes, CGI, and script are all top-notch. Dune lovers have every reason here for rejoicing. One key difference from the Lynch film is that we do not see the Guild Navigators, so we can hope that they show up in the second half!\n\nFino's Dune Reviews\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more",

            "content": "3.5/5 Stars\n\nDune oh Dune, seems like I need to raise my Shield Wall for this review.\n\nDune is one of the most important pieces of literature for the Sci-Fi genre. I ve been raking my brain for hours on how to properly explain the importance of Dune in the sci-fi literature but you know what? I dune (hehehe) think it s necessary for me to do so. If you truly wanna know why, you can search it on whatever search engine you use and you'll find hundreds of articles or reviews on why this book is that important; and they ll do a much better job than me. I won t even deny any of them because, in my opinion, this book was truly revolutionary. Dune didn t become the number one highest selling Sci-fi novel of all time for no reason; like Brian Herbert said, it is to Sci-Fi, what the LOTR trilogy is to fantasy.\n\nTheoretically, if I m reviewing this by putting my head as someone from 1960 s or 1970 s, I know I would think of this book as my bible. 1965 was the year when Dune was published for the first time, 24 years before I was born. There are just too many groundbreaking ideas, world-building, that would become the inspirations for many Sci-fi in our time; I only realized this after reading this book. I mean, the gigantic Sandworm alone has inspired many video games to use it as a common monster or enemy.\n\n\n\n\n\nDesert planet, Stillsuits, space exploration, and Zen Buddhism, Dune was truly a groundbreaking novel, almost everything in this book somehow seems prophetic because it has predicted our current society, especially when it comes to faith, emotional control, empathy, and the importance of ecology and scarcity.\n\n\n\nPart of what made this book was great for me was Herbert s prose. I haven t read enough classic to claim it was classical, but Herbert s prose was definitely unique to me. It has a lot of freedom by writing it from a limited omniscient narrative; changing POV s repeatedly in a single chapter without any warning. This is, honestly, one of my biggest pet peeves in my usual read, but Herbert made it work because all his characters were really well written, distinct in their personality, and the dialogues are really well dune (HEHEHE). Plus, there are so many motivational and extremely philosophical quotes that seem to make this book a combination of Sci-Fi & self-help book, such as:\n\n\n\nAnd of course, the most famous and one of the best quote I ve ever read out of any book\n\n\n\nI can t believe I have gone through life without knowing about this litany against fear. It s applicable in any kind of hardship we faced in real life, and I know it will be one of my motto starting from now. If I m judging this book solely from how significant this book was, I ll give it maximum score in a heartbeat. However, I m reviewing this based on one question and how I rated all the books I read:\n\nThe answer is yes and no, it was a mixed bag. The first part of this book was incredible, I couldn t put down the book and everything was so interesting and compelling. Then comes the second part, where the pacing just became really draggy and somehow, boring. However, my hope was restored for a while during the third act, until the anti-climax happened. My expectation is obviously at fault here but hey, this book is the number one highest selling sci-fi book of all time and one of the most highly acclaimed book, I expected there to be a mind-blowing climax sequences to close the book in an epic way. But no, there wasn t any. Not only it felt anti-climactic, Herbert s prose in describing settings and actions didn t age well or up to current standard. The main reason for this is that this is a book that relies heavily on character s dialogues to do everything; world-building, plot, characterizations were done solely through dialogues. This leads to the great plot but weak action sequences and no vivid settings. Sure there was some explanation on the settings, but other than the planet which is just a desert, just search Sahara or Planet Tatooine and voila the interiors were given only brief description, which makes it hard to imagine; I had to look up some artworks to be able to immerse myself in the settings of the book.\n\nAlthough there were some parts that disappointed me, I still liked the book and I finally understand why there are so much discussion and praises around this book. I recommend this to every Sci-fi fans for its importance and also, it s good to know where most fantastic Sci-Fi you ve read or you re reading now got its idea from. However, this is also where I ll stop with the series.\n\nShow more",

            "content": "I have to write this review without rhythm so that it won t attract a worm.\n\nIn the distant future Arrakis is a hellhole desert planet where anyone who doesn t die of thirst will probably be eaten by one of the giant sandworms. It s also the only place where the precious spice melange can be found so it s incredibly valuable, and the honorable Duke Leto Atreides has been ordered by the Padishah Emperor to take over control of Arrakis from his mortal enemies, the House Harkonnen. While this seems like a great offer on the surface the Duke and his people realize that it s actually a cunning trap being set by the Emperor and Baron Harkonnen.\n\nThe only hope seems to be allying with the local populace called Fremen whose harsh environment has led them to become an incredibly tough and disciplined people, but they have their own vision of what Arrakis should be. They also have a prophecy about the coming of a messiah figure who will lead them to freedom, and the Duke s son Paul looks like he may be exactly who they ve been waiting for.\n\nThis is classic sci-fi that really deserves the label. What Frank Herbert accomplished in one novel is stunning because he built a fascinatingly detailed universe in which the politics, religion, economics, espionage, and military strategy are all equally important. He then blended these more grounded concepts with bigger sci-fi ideas like being able to use spice to see through space-time, and the scope of that encompasses trying to pick the proper path through various potential timelines as well as free will vs. fate.\n\nI think one of the factors that helps this story stay timeless is that so much of it is based on what humanity becomes vs. trying to predict what futuristic technology would be like. This is a society that once had a war with machines and has since rejected any type of computers so people have developed to fill the gap with the help of the spice. The Mentats are trained to use data to predict outcomes. The Navigators of the Guild have used so much of the spice to help them move through space that they re mutating. The all female Bene Gesserit have developed a variety of skills to place their members alongside positions of power to help advance their breeding scheme that spans generations. Herbert also cleverly came up with an excuse that explains why knives and hand-to-hand combat are so important with the idea of the personal body shields.\n\nSo even though we still got a good sci-fi s novel worth of cool gadgets the emphasis is on what the people can do and how that s developed over a long period of time. It also adds a lot of depth to the political dimensions because all of these groups have different agendas that cause them all to mistrust each other, but because they all fill these various roles none can exist without the others.\n\nThere are also parallels to our world that are still in play because the idea of a desert people caught up in the power struggles of various outsiders because of their valuable natural resource is an obvious allegory to the Middle East that still works today. Plus, the classic film came out a few years before Herbert published this, and you have to think that it had some influence on him because there are elements of the story that seem very much inspired by it.\n\nWhile the whole concept of a Chosen One has gotten a bit worn over time that s not Herbert s fault, and this is still a fantastic sci-fi story with big ideas that also works as space opera as well as being an epic adventure story.\nShow more",

( it looks better than David Lynch- Kyle MacLachlan version but the looks may be deceiving! At least Timothy and Zendaya look so cool in those stylish clothes and grimy expressions on their faces)\n\nAfter nearly three decades later, holding this paperback into my hands is magical experience take me a time travel: my mom was banging on my room s door and telling me go outside and be social, getting some tan, instead of self-isolating myself by burying my head into books for days and feeding myself with junk food! ( the past mom had no idea, billions of people in the earth will be forced to do the similar things I ve done in 2020 because of different reasons . At least the 2020-me did exactly same things with one difference: I threw boozes into equation! )\n\nWhen I reread the series I clearly understand why I became addicted to the them( I m talking about entire books)\n\nFirstly you find yourself drawn into this journey after reading few pages because Herbert s storytelling skills are extraordinarily. The meaningful interludes, the character development, the impressive world building transform you to the other universe that you never want to leave.\n\nThe awakening parts of Paul who discovers his own abilities, epic dynasty battles, ominous sand worms , intrigues, revenge, mind games present us a perfect blend of political economical, sociological, theological themes.\nI advise you to read the books first to understand the deeply ideological messages and unique philosophy of the series because sometimes the screenwriters have hard time to absorb and reflect the entire soul of the book! At least by reading the main story by yourself, you may directly reach to the core!\n\nHere are my favorite quotes of the book:\n\n I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain. \n\n Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic. \n\n The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve, but a reality to experience. \n\n When religion and politics travel in the same cart, the riders believe nothing can stand in their way. Their movements become headlong - faster and faster and faster. They put aside all thoughts of obstacles and forget the precipice does not show itself to the man in a blind rush until it's too late. \n\n Hope clouds observation. \n\n It is impossible to live in the past, difficult to live in the present and a waste to live in the future. \n\n Fear is the mind killer. \n\n Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them. \nShow more",

This book was a bit of a mess with the characters, world, and plot all feeling a bit disjointed and half baked. The world, while interesting and obviously very detailed, is barely explained to the reader and relies heavily on the appendix without actually providing context in the story (with the exception of a few things like spice and the worms). These characters all felt a little flat and/or underutilized. The plot felt like two separate books, while being peppered with themes of glorifying colonialism, white saviors, and lack of agency for most of the women. Although I understand that is a product of when it was written, it still points to how there are much better works that have been written since even if they were influenced by this. I m interested to see what they do with the movie adaptation. I ll have a review and discussion on my channel coming up.\nShow more",

            "content": "15-9-2021: saw the movie tonight and loved it s esthetics and how it conveys the gravitas of the story\n\nLike medieval (but the Islamic enlightenment version of it) times, a caste system and the oil industry imposed upon space opera, with mystical elements permeating the whole and simultaneously telling the rise of a Napoleon like hero. Dune sounds like a book that shouldn t work, but does, in an unique, complex and compelling manner.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last 25% of the book was a wild ride that really upped my enjoyment of this reread, and left me impressed with the worldbuilding and boldness of .\nBut to start: is a classic in the scifi field, but is quite atypical. Technological progress has stalled after a jihad against thinking machines (aka computers) and a kind of medieval society in space has emerged. An emperor reigns, planets are dished out as fiefs and mysterious sects () follow their own paths to influence events. Some kind of social darwinism is at play, and the conviction that humanity can be massively better (or worse) is we return our attention to oneself instead of towards technology.\n\nThe terms are at the start quite hard to get into, even though I know the story and remember some of them from last time reading the book. Arrakis, the Dune from the title, is an other interesting thing. This desert planet is almost a separate character (), being handed to the Atreides duke and worsening a blood feud with the Harkonnens, the previous owners of the planet.\n\nIt is interesting how Herbert decided to reveal the first murder plot perpetrator quite soon, showing evidently that this is a book more about ideas then tension.\nIn general the book is biblical in language and the weight assigned to events, with foreshadowing and myths. The world feels rich and alive.\n\nThe main character is Paul Atreides, the son of duke Leto. He is groomed to take on his role of leader of a major house, and by his Bene Gesserit mother Jessica (who is, for lack of a better analogy, a kind of crossing between a martial arts expert, nun and witch). There are several other retainers, who are depicted in a manner that I can only compare to .\nThe characters in general feel greater than life, for instance the level of perception and deduction at the dinner party is superhuman, I can only imagine because there is no advanced technology that the psychic training must somehow become more advanced and leads to the kind of casual analysis Jessica and Paul are capable of.\n\nThe fall of house Atreides is still a brutal event, even if you know it is coming and feels swift and unexpected, as does Paul s enlightenment.\n\n\n\n\nTo be fair, halfway in the book I felt a kind of lull in reading. The main characters are thrown back upon themselves and need to establish themself amongst the Freemen, Bedouin like desert folk who are much more powerful than thought.\nIn these sections there is such a sensitivity to culture and worldbuilding, Tatooine or the Aiel of are nothing compared to the depth Herbert manages to bring go Arrakis and its Freemen. So much must have been thought of but has been left out, given a richness in the world conjured that is only rivaled by Middle Earth.\n\nThe scenes are intense, and well written, but in way a bit dull since the ascent of Paul to power seems assured. There is banter that is really sharp, like:\n\n\nAnd Paul is shown as doubting, self aware of his rise and what it entails, commenting on heroism and mythmaking, and the restraints to his powers: ()\n\nBut the third part, especially to the end, shows real boldness by skipping two years and taking on tragic events (), sometimes only in an indirect manner.\nAlia is a good example, and all the implications and struggles, guilt, she must bring with her. You feel it, it is touched upon, but never in an on the nose manner.\nAnd the development of the relationship between Stilgar and Paul also carries sadness and an awareness of the corrosive power of adoration and myth:\n\nThe epicness of both the story and main character Paul (and a shoutout to Chani and Jessica as well) is just beyond anything.\nFor instance somewhere near the end Paul responds the following to a warning that the galactic emperor is coming down upon him in force:\n\n\n\nDecadence as an indication of ineffectiveness and decline, while orthodoxy, returning to the core of human struggle for life, is a way out of the impasse, comes back as a theme.\n\nThe actual enlightenment and power of Paul as gained by the spice is unknowable to a reader, since he operates on another level entirely. Time being a dimension, Paul transcends the three dimensions and becomes something inhuman along the way, a singularity like the technical singularity.\n\n\n\n\n\nOk , what is this convenient weirding suddenly along the way?\nWhy is count Fenring there, what does he add in anyway to the story?\nAnd how the hell does Paul get nuclear weapons all of the sudden.\nAnd as said: the second part of the book really did not speak that much to me.\n\nBut in no way it can be denied that the world conjured by Dune is rich, bold and interesting, and that I very much look forward to see the movie in 2021!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more",

            "content": "As a teenager,  Dune  blew my mind. I fell into the story and loved all the grandiose ideas. Over time, I reread the novel at least a half dozen times and read the follow-on novels. Looking back over time, I idolize it a bit less, recognizing some flaws, but it will always have a special place in my literary heart. For me, it's still one of the very best.\n\n A beginning is a very delicate time. \n\nFrom a literary standpoint, my favorite thing is how it throws us in the middle of a universe 20,000 years in the future and makes no attempt to explain the backstory. And there is an incredibly rich backstory. There is a spacefaring Old Empire, which became corrupt and fell. There was an AI Superintelligence that enslaved mankind, only to be overthrown, itself, leaving a universe where technology is used scarcely and carefully such as human computers knows as mentats. There is the founding of the Bene Gesserit religious cult, a collection of women whose goal is to manipulate mankind towards stability and enlightenment. None of this is clearly explained in the original novel, which really pushes the reader to deep curiosity and to make many inferences. It s this iceberg approach which gave me the most joy when reading it.\n\n Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me.\"\n\nFrom a science fiction standpoint, it s filled with wonderous ideas   alien creatures (sandworms), space travel, cool ornithopter craft, and of course the trippy, psychic power-inducing spice! So, despite having to infer all the intricate backstory, we do get to experience firsthand an imaginative, fully realized alien future.\n\n He who controls the spice, controls the universe. \n\nSo, what are the flaws? Well, perhaps the biggest, which it shares with many epic western stories (Last of the Mohicans, The Last Samurai, Dances with Wolves, Avatar, etc.) is the  white savior  trope. I think it s a valid criticism, but in Dune, Paul embraces the Fremen culture and does not try to change them or tell them how to live. This is addressed more deeply in the follow-on novels, as well. Another is treatment of women (largely - through the Bene Gesserit) as conniving and manipulative. In addition, women are used for marriage to develop alliances. Finally, one could make a case that the book explores eugenics, possibly the most problematic issue. It s not far off from the concerns in Star Wars with midichlorians and the Skywalker bloodline. I personally find it difficult to defend any type of eugenics as an ethical plot device.\n\n Irulan shall be my wife, opening the way for an Atreides to take the throne. \n\nHowever, on the positive side, the plot has some real strengths. It s clearly anti-colonialist and pro-environmentalist long before it was cool to be those things. It questions the powers of church and state and examines the implications of culture-clash. Capitalistic greed is cast in a very ugly light. One might even call it anti-western thinking. There are strong female characters with intelligence and real power. And, through its backstory, it also examines the dangers of overreliance on technology.\n\n The willow submits to the wind and prospers until one day it is many willows a wall against the wind. This is the willow s purpose. \n\nDespite what your jeweler will tell you, no diamond is truly flawless.  Dune  remains a masterpiece, in scale, ideas, and storytelling. It s not perfect, but it s influential and entertaining. Five sand blown stars for this epic, complex, and well-told masterpiece.\nShow more",

            "content": "Welcome to Unpopular Review Time! Where I go against what almost everyone else says about a book.\n\nBefore we start, please do not be fooled by the three star rating. Even if I didn't like really like the book, I have to acknowledge there are reasons why Dune is a cornerstone of the Sci Fi genre.\n\nNow, let's talk about the important stuff.\n\n\n\nWe get a new planet, and while it's obvious that Herbert based his desert planet on real sights and cultures, it's still awesome. The Fremen and their culture, the stillsuits, the worms, the plight for water... It's all explained in such a vivid detail without being boring or repetitive. And while reading you can see the references! Can we talk about how many movies and books have been influenced by this?\n\n\n\nWe also get a future Empire where machines are no longer used for computation purposes. Instead, humans have been trained to unlock their full brain potential and make such calculations. And we get two schools of these \"enhanced\" humans: the Bene Gesserit and the Mentats. And we get lots of details explaining this new society: the Empire, the Noble Houses, the Guild, how each group interacts with the others, the intrigue surrounding all dealings...\n\n\n\nPaul, is the 'Chosen One', the Lisan al-Gaib, the Kwisatz Haderach. He gets many names. After a betrayal, he finds refuge among the Fremen and seeks revenge from those who wronged his house.\n\n\n\nHere comes my first problem with the book, you can divide it in a before and after around the betrayal point. (I'm not spoiling anything by telling you this, believe me, the book will tell you ALL about it)\n\nThe story is told in a third person omniscient point of view, and the author uses this liberally, giving us a peek into the different characters' thoughts. And he loves repeating ideas. So we get to know about the betrayal from the bad guy who planned it, from the traitor himself, from everyone inside House Atreides who knows that there's a traitor and suspects everyone,... and all this before anything actually happens! When the scene finally rolls in I was so tired of the plot I almost gave up on the book.\n\nAfter this the plot actually picks up and there's lots of action. However I had some more problems with it, as I'll explain ahead.\n\nWhile they were all artfully created and developed;\n\nThe way Herbert planned his 'Chosen One' and his society, most of the characters are deeply logical and, dare I say, stuffy? They think and re-think, and plan and plot, and think again, computing everything with a very small dose of humanity. (Ha! And they call themselves humans.)\n\nPaul is wise beyond his years, not only by his training, but by his evolution during the story. It made me think of another chosen child: Harry Potter, but where we all wanted to be Harry, or at least one of his friends; I really had no thought of befriending this one. (I did pity him a lot.)\n\nAnd then there's the bad guy! Oh Gods. I've never in my life seen such a TERRIBLE antagonist and I don't say this lightly.\n\n\n\nHe's a fat ugly guy, who cannot even move himself. He's a pedophile, a slave worker, treats everyone horribly including his own family. There is absolutely no redeeming quality to this guy. He's almost cartoonish in how bad he is.\n\nAnd I never ever got his hate for the Atreides, I can understand greed, personal vendettas, house wars. But his hate seemed too personal and at the same time too huge to be understandable. Also, he was the typical movie villain that loved to rehash his plots over and over again, and brag about how cunning he was. Complete freaking waste of time.\n\nLast, but not least. and I DID NOT like it. Call me romantic, call me naive, call me soft. I don't care. I thought that last paragraph was the wrong thing to say.\n\nI suggest you read it. If only so you can see Star Wars in a pretty different light.\n\n---\n\n'The Defeat of the Sarduakar' by John Schoenherr.\n\"Fremen of Dune\" by\n\"Vladimir Harkonnen\" by\nShow more",

            "content": "I ve been sitting at this keyboard for longer than I care to admit trying to coalesce my thoughts about Dune into something coherent. You already know it s fantastic though, right? Dune is one of those novels that is spoken of in reverential tones by seasoned reader and relative newbie alike. It s considered by many to be THE best sci-fi novel of all time and Herbert s son, Brian Herbert, rightfully calls it sci-fi s equivalent to Lord of the Rings for inspiring all that came after its publication.\n\nSo, I mean, what in the name of Shai-Hulud am I supposed to add to that?\n\nWell, I ll begin with the story of how I came to read . I m sure that there have been ample opportunities to read the book. I can remember seeing the black-spine amidst a forest of other spines on my cousin s bookshelf, of which I had free reign. Yet something always kept me from picking it up. It could have been my obsession with fantasy novels at that time with only the briefest allowances for sci-fi. Whatever the reason, the book continued to pop up. Its sliver of desert on a black background called to me from piles at used bookstores, the shelves of friends and relatives, and even on public transportation. All the same, I never got around to it.\n\nTwo factors finally made the difference. The first, my well-read friend (Josh Bragg in real life, but he s on Goodreads too!) always brought it up as one of the best books he s ever read. He also took the opportunity to remind me to read it whenever book recommendations went flying between us and, foolishly, I kept putting him off. But I m a sucker for a great looking book and these Penguin Galaxy sci-fi collections sealed the deal for me. Their elegant cover designs, the intros by Neil Gaiman, a selection of books I d always been meaning to read, AND was on it? I was absolutely delighted to find the book under the tree on Christmas morning and tore into it in earnest.\n\n\n\nThough it took near 200 pages to really pick up speed, the novel had me hooked from its immersive opening. Here was a world that was familiar and strange at the same time. There are elements of fantasy and religion coupled with interplanetary travel and space empires. The characters touted titles that were inscrutable at the beginning, but became part of my vocabulary before the novel s end. The novel refused to tell me everything I needed to understand, secreting mysteries without ever outright stating them. How could I not want to know what Kwisatz Haderach meant? How could I not want to know the secrets of Arrakis?\n\n\n\n\nI was swept away by this novel that mixes sci-fi concepts of higher dimensions with political intrigue. Environmental change mixed with an unlimited cast of enthralling characters, and a drop of religious philosophy. is a novel of the highest order: it combines entertainment with brilliant questions that pull from an incredible number of disciplines. Of course, if you just want to read a compelling tale of political plotting, murder, adventure, and discovery, you can totally do that too.\n\nIn the afterword, Brian Herbert notes a conversation he had with his father about the writing and structure of . Frank Herbert constructed so that it would be immensely dense. Herbert wanted to create a tale that could be enjoyed on the level of the central conflict: a boy becoming a man trying to reclaim his heritage against astounding odds in a world beyond imagining. Here s an excerpt from that afterword about the layers.\n\n\n\nThe fact that the novel can be enjoyed from any number of different readings alone makes it a novel of huge significance. doesn t force you into thinking, but it invites the interested to partake in its rich metaphor and multifaceted meaning. What s more, Herbert makes statements about his concepts, but rarely does he offer them as the only solution (barring, perhaps, an ecological viewpoint that bemoans industrialization). I dove into different fields of thought between and during readings. I contemplated elegant ideas Herbert proposes and marveled at the structure of the plot and the boundless ideas of this world.\n\nWhat a world it is! The world building here could fill a university course as Herbert establishes a world unlike any other, but totally believable. When I read about the stillsuit I was astonished by its creativity, but also how it imparted valuable information about the world of Arrakis. Though the sandworms scream for attention throughout the novel, equal care is given to the hierarchy of the Empire, the mystical Bene Gesserit religion, and the curiosities of culture. Herbert also seems to have invented a group of hallucinogenic compounds that are in equal parts trippy, interesting, and betray an interesting look at 1960s culture.\n\n\n\nOf course, when the ride does end, it is immensely satisfying. ends leaving unanswered questions in a fashion that made me feel like I knew enough to be entirely contented. Which, of course, begs the question: will I read the other novels?\n\nWelllllllllllllllll, maybe.\n\nIt s highly daunting to look at the entire and think that I would tackle that. Especially when ends in a way that makes me so happy, and especially when the subsequent novels purportedly deliver diminishing returns. For now, I m too overjoyed and impressed by to consider returning to the world anytime soon other than to re-read the novel.\n\nObviously, I can t recommend enough. That s also not a recommendation that goes to the sci-fi crowd alone. Oh no, this is a book that has great appeal to a wide variety of people. You like ? Perfect: you ll love the backstabbing, the plots-within-plots, the combat, the story. You don t read sci-fi? No worries: there s a wealth of important themes upon which to reflect. You like sci-fi, your friends continuously recommend you read , and you keep putting it off?\n\nGoodreadians, I think you know what you need to do!\nShow more",

            "content": "Like most of my five star books, I ve read Dune multiple times. In fact, I d say that what makes a book more than just enjoyable and instead truly amazing is that you want to read it more than once and are rewarded for doing so. I ve probably read Dune six times, and I ve never gotten tired of it but my understanding of the work has increased over time.\n\nTo begin with, the first time I read Dune, I got about three pages into it, realized I didn t understand a thing and that I was hopelessly confused. I had to go back and reread what I had read, and then go back again and reread the whole chapter. I would excuse myself by saying that I was 10, but I m sure I m not the only one that has had that experience. Don t be dismayed if it happens to you - whether 10, 18, or 45. If you are confused at first, consider that Paul is also confused and finds so much that happens strange and new. Understanding will come in its proper time.\n\nAt one time at least, there was a fairly famous website (at least among geeks) that humorously summarized books in thirty words or less. Maybe it still exists, but its name escapes me. The summary provided for Dune read something like this,  I m Frank Herbert and I m a lot smarter than you are.  When I was younger, this would have seemed a fair appraisal of the work. One of the most central aspects of  Dune  is Herbert manages to write convincingly about people whose intelligence is supposed to vastly exceed that of the reader. More than anything, to create a believable Messianic story, the writer has to create a Messiah possessing believable Messianic wisdom and insight, and Herbert succeeds at this invention probably better than any other writer. We come to believe that the protagonists do have deep and profound insight into the question of  Life, the Universe, and Everything  so that we do not immediately feel cheated and we are able to believe in the characters   even someone like Maud Dib. As I ve gotten older, and hopefully wiser, I ve come to see that Herbert is not in fact possessed of superhuman intelligence, but that he creates the illusion of superhuman intelligence by a variety of clever devices. The appearance of a superhuman intelligence and wisdom is really a sham and the pool is really pretty shallow, but even this revelation does not reduce the esteem in which I hold the work. It s not Herbert s real job to be a prophet: he s an artist. Herbert succeeds brilliantly in what he should be judged on   the ability to paint the illusion deftly and convincingly. If we acquire the sophistication to see through it, it shouldn t reduce our appreciation of the artistic mastery used in creating it. I think now I would amend the summary of the work to be,  I m Frank Herbert, and I m a lot better writer than you are. \n\nIf all that could be said in Dune s favor was that it had one of the most convincing invented prophets in literature, it would still be a worthwhile work. But Dune has abundant pleasures beyond the richly realized illusion of philosophical depth and even the deftly realized setting. Chief among these for me is the truly deep and intricate relationships Paul has with the other characters. There is a real depth of feeling here, and I love the way each of the complicated nuanced relationships is portrayed as we are introduced to the cast of Paul s complicated life. Each character feels a deep mixture of feelings for Paul who is boy, man, friend, soldier, sovereign, and Messiah and much else. There is tenderness to this work. We sense that complexity and tenderness right from the start, when his mother allows him to be tortured and to face murder, and then immediately thereafter experiences profound hope and joy:  My son lives.  We feel Paul s boyish love for his friends and companions, who are also his father s henchmen and his teachers and who he is in turn their future Lord. We feel the more mature manly love that these companions have for their young charge and future ruler. Even Yueh loves the boy he must destroy. We feel the boyish admiration Paul has for his father as he strains to be worthy of him and to make his father proud, and we feel the returned pride and satisfaction that his father feels. We feel the aching love of a boy for this Mother when he has already lost everything else when Jessica is buried in sand, and we feel her returned love when she says,  I knew you would find me. \n\nAnd though there love is only briefly on stage, still I find the love between Paul and Chani among the sweetest and most charming in literature. Who cannot thrill when scarcely knowing each other, but seeing their lives together stretching out before them both good and terrible, the young becoming but not yet lovers promise with tender vows nonetheless to be forever each other's comfort and joy and they feel their hitherto unseen future becoming a real solid now. Isn t that how it is in some way for all of us when we meet the one who will be the one and we suddenly realize we want to and we will spend the rest of our lives together regardless of what will happen? And how often have we felt the total unabashed joy as Paul does when we know our lover is now near?\n\n That could only mean Chani was near by Chani, his soul, Chani his sihaya, sweet as the desert spring, Chani up from the palmaries of the deep south. \n\nAll that and  Dune  is a wonderful exciting action adventure story filled with thrills and chases, fights and battles, and supersized edge of our imagination wonders. Worms.\n\nIt s no wonder that this is one of the best beloved books of all time. If you haven t read it, you should. If you have read it, read it again.\nShow more",

            "content": "I MEAN ... WHERE THE FUCK DO I REALLY EVEN START??? It's been a long time since I've been sucked into a FANTASY / SCI-FI world and didn't wanna leave it. Early examples of that happening include Potter, the Ink world and Lord of the Rings (first through the movies, and later the books).\n\nIn recent years, it has only happened with A Song of Ice and Fire and The Kingkiller Chronicles   two unfinished series ... a fate that DUNE, unfortunately, shares. [Can you hear me screaming all across the universe, Frank???]\n\nAnyways, I stopped reading fantasy and sci-fi for the simple reason that I was no longer excited by it. I read so much from these genres over my young adolescence (most notably fantasy ... sci-fi was never really my thing) that it felt right to \"move on\" at one point. I never regretted it, and rarely look back.\n\nBUT when I saw in theatres, I felt a like an excitable kid again. That movie had me hooked. From the first minute on, I knew I would be going on one hell of a ride. I saw the film with my best friend and we both couldn't believe what we had just witnessed. Cinema history akin to (or at least that's how I imagine the people who got out of the cinema back in the early 2000s). This is a FRANCHISE that one can work with. This is something that will stick with us for the next couple of years, especially if they make TWO more movies (instead of just one).\n\ndidn't have that typical sci-fi feel (...my only reference point is tho, lmao). It felt much more like set in space. What drives forward is not its setting and all of the space travel, it's the political intrigue.\nWhen Duke Leto Atreides gets the order from the Padisha Emperor Saddam IV to replace his cousin, the Baron Harkonnen, as ruler of the planet Arrakis (also known as DUNE), he knows that that's not a gift. The Emperor is intimidated by Leto's power and that he's held in high esteem by the other Higher Houses of the universe. And therefore Leto (along with the other Atreides) must be stopped. What then ensues is an exhilarating and complex net of plots which focuses on the all encompassing question of power. What makes a good ruler? Who is \"allowed\" to rule? What about the people who are ruled?\n\nI didn't expect to be as psychological and philosophical as it was ... even though I heard it gets even more META throughout the rest of the series (CAN'T WAIT!). At the heart of the story, we follow Paul Atreides, son of Duke Leto, as he moves with his parents and their entourage from Caladan to Arrakis.\n\n\n\n\nPaul was trained throughout his young life (he is 15 at the beginning of the book) by his mother, Lady Jessica, in her Bene Gesserit ways. The Bene Gesserit are a pseudo-religious organization of all-women spies, nuns, scientists, and theologians who use genetic experimentation, galactic political interference, and religious engineering to further their own agenda of ascending the human race with the advent of their chosen one, the Kwisatz Haderach. Paul struggles with the burden his mother has chosen for him. He knows that there is no such thing as \"the chosen one\"; it's a farce, a manipulation   and yet something he can't escape.\n\nNot gonna lie, I had my problems with Herbert's writing throughout the first third of the book. I have never read something quite like it. I know lots of people had problems with the rich world building in because Herbert tends to throw hundreds of terms (unique to his world) around without any explanation for them in the text; but having seen the movie BEFOREHAND (something I would highly recommend) made it SUPER EASY for me to picture everything and follow along. No, the problem I had was the actual WRITING STYLE. At first, it felt really clunky and ... just weird? Like, not literary at all? I know I'm doing a piss poor job at explaining it but at first I felt like I was reading a weird fanfiction of the movie (LMAO).\n\nBut when I got used to the writing and accepted it for what it is, I got reeeeaally lost in the book. And was actually amazed at how MODERN??? the writing felt. Like, could've literally been written in the 21st century. The writing definitely didn't feel OLD, even though it felt WEIRD in some parts. :D\n\nAnyways, I finished within three days (which is a feat for me ... the book is almost 700 pages long and I usually only read 50 pages a day). It was a true page turner, especially two-thirds into the book   when we finally got to the part of the story that wasn't shown in the movie   I was glued to the pages. I couldn't believe what was happening. All the twists and turns were just AMAZING. And the ending was puurrrfect. [I really like that can be read as a standalone ... especially since I don't feel like committing to a 6-book-series that isn't even finished and literally 20+ extra novels that Herbert's son wrote to broaden the universe.]\n\nis not a book I'd recommend to just anyone. You must have an appetite for it. You must be willing to forgive its author a couple of things for full enjoyment (like the role of women in the story, and that there are very few female characters to begin with; or Herbert's homophobia which comes through in his portrayal of the Baron Harkonnen). If you can't do that, you won't have a fun time. But if you really WANT to go on this journey, then will hold many adventures and purse-clutching moments for you.\n\n: THE LITANY OF FEAR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more",

He continuously tells the reader what each character is thinking through italicized internal dialogue. Sometimes uses the third person narration to do the same thing in a more elegant way. The problem is that he does both, often times for the same character in the same paragraph. It's super clunky, and took me out of the story every time.\nShow more",

            "content": "Just to clarify: Yes, I did cry.\n\nI've read a lot of positive and negative reviews for this book. I can see why people wouldn't like it - I really can. Perhaps because I took a lot out of it personally, I found I enjoyed it a lot.\n\nQuick test to see if you'll like this book:\n\n1. Did you like Anne of Green Gables?\n2. Can you cope with an off-beat, melancholy, caustic, dead-pan, self-righteous narrator?\n3. Do you like words?\n(Questions 4-8 were all about what kind of underwear you're wearing so don't worry about them).\n\nSo, let's all gather around for story time with Mistress Kat.\n\nTwo incidents set me off lately.\n\n1. My neighbour came to me and complained about the Islanders (for those not Australian: the Tongan, Fiji, Papa New Guinea and New Zealand populations of Australia) causing trouble and otherwise defiling our great and beautiful nation.\n2. I was tooling around on Facebook when I noticed one of my friends (one of those friends you ve never met except in an internet community) hosting a link to a video of a speech from a man addressing the American people. I wouldn t go so far as to say that he is reminiscent of a neo-Hitler but let s just say that the comparison would not be wholly unearned. Her comments on the video were that: everything he d said was right, it was time that people sat up and listened for the sake of their country and that it s about time  somebody did something . (Fuck me, I ve heard this phrase so many times. What is it exactly that they re referring to? Do they actually know? I ve yet to hear them pronounce what this  something  is or what it looks like. Is there some plan that I m not aware of that they re referring to? Does it involve chipmunks, honey and tequila?)\n\nTo my neighbour, I simply mumbled that I had to leave and got in my car. I was offended on behalf of my friends so I blew him off and I haven t really spoken to him since. To my Facebook friend, I resisted the urge to make any comments. I debated about starting a fight that would, in all likelihood, spill over to our community. In the end I ignored her and I haven t spoken to her since.\n\nThe Book Thief is not your typical WWII story. It doesn t even ask you to sympathize with the Jews. Their plight is background to the story and their struggles and pains are rarely shown except through the pitiful/beautiful character of Max. This story actually focuses on the bad guys. Zusak assumes that you know about the struggle and the plight of the Jews. He assumes that you feel for them, that you are horrified on their behalf and so he doesn t spend much time eliciting an emotion that you are expected to have.\n\nInstead it focuses on the BAD guys. You get to know and live the lives of a small and poor town in Germany. The thing is, though, that these aren t really the bad guys. Zusak, probably rightly, assumes that we d never be able to really empathize and enjoy reading a book about characters truly bad. They re not really bad. After all, they may be Germans and they may have escaped persecution and death, but they re still poor. They re the tiny fraction of the German population who sympathizes with the Jews. They harbour a Jewish man in their home and come to love him. The thing is though that for most of the novel, they re not the good guys either. They don t speak up for the Jewish people, they don t try to change popular opinion, they don t stand for what s right. They quietly try to get by without causing waves and without risking much of themselves.\n\nSo you can see how I would sympathize. How could I think that I m one of the  good guys  when I don t stand up for people either? Shouldn t I have challenged my neighbour and asked how he knew that the Islanders were to blame for all the crime? Shouldn t I have asked him how many Islanders he knew? How he could make such assumptions about people? Shouldn t I have challenged my facebook friend? Shouldn t I have asked her why she s spreading propaganda? Couldn t I have probed her to think critically about this man s claims, about facts and ethics?\n\nNo. I didn t want to cause problems and I didn t want to make waves.\n\nThe narrator of The Book Thief makes a claim that Hitler s took over a country and started a war   not with guns or weapons but with words. I ve read others consider this claim to be stupid and ridiculous but I actually agree with him.\n\nWhen I was a child I asked my Great Aunt Nell why she insisted on engaging me in long and tedious hypothetical debates about morality, human nature, ethics and theology. Her response was always the same: if you don t fill a child s head with all the right stuff, someone will come along and fill it with all the wrong stuff. It s kind of like those corny motivational quotes that the teachers post in their rooms: Those who stand for nothing fall for anything.\n\nWell, I agree. When you don t educate people, when you don t teach them to think critically, with full understanding and proper knowledge, then other people come along and whisper in their ear and fill their heads up with mindless rot. Hitler told the German people how to think. He told them who was Wrong. Why they were Wrong. How to fix the Wrong. What was Right. Then he did the most powerful thing a person could do: he told them a story. When you tell a whole nation a story about the future   a gloriously bright future with Plenty and Joy; a future in which they are redeemed and have conquered their enemies; a future in which they are happy and Everything Is As It Should Be   and if you tell that story well enough, then you can conquer a country and wage a war without ever firing a single bullet.\n\nCoincidently when you don t speak up, when you don t proclaim the truth, when you re too afraid to replace ignorance with knowledge then you re no better than an accomplice to a crime. I can t imagine how my friends would feel if they d known that I stood by and allowed them and their family and children to be slandered like that. Pretty appalled, I imagine   and rightfully so.\n\nAnd now we come to the big reason why I think a lot of people didn t like this book   the narrator.\n\nThe Hunger Games did a similar thing to The Book Thief. It sought to instil in its readers a sense of proper shame. However, as opposed to The Book Thief, you didn t feel judged. After all, for the Sins that The Hunger Games was preaching of, we re all guilty   and in our combined guilt there seems to be a lessening of accountability. Perhaps there s a sense that we re all going down together. When we re damned, at least we ll have good company, right? The Book Thief, however, singles you out as solely responsible. It strips you naked and looks down on you as it asks you to account of yourself. Not even the narrator can sympathize with you because he is the only one left blameless and innocent, looking upon us with a reserved kind of pity and bewilderment.\n\nMaybe I m a glutton for punishment. I don t mind being stripped down. I don t mind being reprimanded and so I loved this book. I loved this book for inspiring me to be even more outlandishly outspoken and persistently and doggedly forthcoming on my opinions of these issues. I loved this book because I loved the narrator. I loved this book because I loved the story.\n\nI loved this book because I now have the PERFECT excuse to start a helluva lot more fights.\n\nFor some reason, that thought makes me very happy.\n\nShow more",

            "content": "This is a book to treasure, a new classic. I absolutely loved it.\n\nSet in Germany in the years 1939-1943, The Book Thief tells the story of Liesel, narrated by Death who has in his possession the book she wrote about these years. So, in a way, they are both book thieves. Liesel steals randomly at first, and later more methodically, but she's never greedy. Death pockets Liesel's notebook after she leaves it, forgotten in her grief, amongst the destruction that was once her street, her home, and carries it with him.\n\nLiesel is effectively an orphan. She never knew her father, her mother disappears after delivering her to her new foster parents, and her younger brother died on the train to Molching where the foster parents live. Death first encounters nine-year-old Liesel when her brother dies, and hangs around long enough to watch her steal her first book, , left lying in the snow by her brother's grave.\n\nHer foster parents, Hans and Rosa Herbermann, are poor Germans given a small allowance to take her in. Hans, a tall, quiet man with silver eyes, is a painter (of houses etc.) and plays the accordian. He teaches Liesel how to read and write. Rosa is gruff and swears a lot but has a big heart, and does laundry for rich people in the town. Liesel becomes best friends with her neighbour Rudy, a boy with \"hair the colour of lemons\" who idolises the black Olympic champion sprinter Jesse Owens.\n\nOne night a Jew turns up in their home. He's the son of a friend of Hans from the first world war, the man who taught him the accordian, whose widowed wife Hans promised to help if she ever needed it. Hans is a German who does not hate Jews, though he knows the risk he and his family are taking, letting Max live in the basement. Max and Liesel become close friends, and he writes an absolutely beautiful story for her, called , which damn near broke my heart. It's the story of Max, growing up and coming to Liesel's home, and it's painted over white-painted pages of , which you can see through the paint.\n\nWhenever I read a book, I cannot help but read it in two ways: the story itself, and how it's written. They're not quite inseparable, but they definitely support each other. With , Markus Zusak has shown he's a writer of genius, an artist of words, a poet, a literary marvel. His writing is lyrical, haunting, poetic, profound. Death is rendered vividly, a lonely, haunted being who is drawn to children, who has had a lot of time to contemplate human nature and wonder at it. Liesel is very real, a child living a child's life of soccer in the street, stolen pleasures, sudden passions and a full heart while around her bombs drop, maimed veterans hang themselves, bereaved parents move like ghosts, Gestapo take children away and the dirty skeletons of Jews are paraded through the town.\n\nMany things save this book from being all-out depressing. It's never morbid, for a start. A lively humour dances through the pages, and the richness of the descriptions as well as the richness of the characters' hearts cannot fail to lift you up. Also, it's great to read such a balanced story, where ordinary Germans - even those who are blond and blue-eyed - are as much at risk of losing their lives, of being persecuted, as the Jews themselves.\n\nI can't go any further without talking about the writing itself. From the very first title page, you know you're in for something very special indeed. The only way to really show you what I mean is to select a few quotes (and I wish I was better at keeping track of lines I love).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting like this is not something just anyone can do: it's true art. Only a writer of Zusak's talent could make this story work, and coud get away with such a proliferation of adjectives and adverbs, to write in such a way as to revitalise the language and use words to paint emotion and a vivid visual landscape in a way you'd never before encountered. This is a book about the power of words and language, and it is fitting that it is written in just such this way.\n\nThe way this book was written also makes me think of a musical, or an elaborate, flamboyant stage-play. It's in the title pages for each part, in Death's asides and manner of emphasing little details or even speech, in the way Death narrates, giving us the ending at the beginning, giving little melodrammatic pronouncements that make you shiver. It's probably the first book I've read that makes me feel how I feel watching , if that helps explain it.\n\nAnd it made me cry.\nShow more",

            "content": " When death captures me,  the boy vowed,  he will feel my fist on his face. \nPersonally, I quite like that. Such stupid gallantry.\nYes.\nI like that a lot.\n\nA few days ago, when I was starting The Book Thief, my mother stopped by and saw the book on my coffee table. Having just read it herself (and knowing me better than anyone else in the world, I might add), she was determined to save me from myself. She did her very best to convince me not to read it. She described in detail the three day long headache all the crying had caused her and the heartache she now has to live with, but I m nothing if not stubborn. I guess I never learned to listen to my mother.\nI m pretty sure her parting sentence was:  Don t come crying to me.  And I didn t. I huddled in a corner and cried inconsolably instead.\n\nDeath himself narrates the story about a little girl named Liesel growing up with her foster parents in Nazi Germany. At the beginning, I felt somewhat intimidated by the idea of Death as a narrator. I assumed that his voice would be dark and thunderous, but for the most part, he was a ray of light illuminating earth s saddest time. Incredibly insightful observations and occasional dry humor are only some of the things no one but Death could have brought into this story. Besides, we hear people calling God s name every day for many reasons, but when Death calls to Him in despair and even those calls fall on deaf ears, no one can fail to understand the gravity of the situation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Book Thief is not one of those books you read compulsively, desperate to find out what s on the next page. No. It is, in fact, better to read it slowly, in small doses, in a way that allows you to savor every word and absorb the power and the magic it contains. All the while, you know what s going to happen. Death has no patience for mysteries. However, anticipation of the inevitable makes it even worse. My whole body was tingling with fear because I knew what was coming and I knew that it was only a matter of time.\nZusak found a way to give a fresh approach to a much-told story. He offered a glimpse at the other side of the coin. Really, should we feel sorry for the people hiding in a basement in Munich suburbs? Sure, bombs are falling on their heads, but most of them are members of the Nazi Party, willingly or reluctantly. Some of them truly think that Jews are no better than rats. Some, on the other hand, are hiding a Jew in their own basement. Some are just innocent children. But the more important question is, are we any better at all if we don t feel compassion and sorrow? Death does a great job of asking all these questions in a calm, unobtrusive way.\n\nI m not pretentious enough to believe that my clumsy words can ever do this book justice. I won t even try. Time will speak for it, as I m pretty sure it will survive for decades and generations to come. The Book Thief and Markus Zusak should find their place in every school textbook all over the world.\n\n\nSeven thousand stars could never be enough for this book.\n\nEDIT: A few words from the man himself:\n\n\n\nShow more",

            "content": "I put off reading this book for the library book club. Here are my three reasons for doing so:\n\n1) It's a Young Adult Book. I am an Adult. It can't be that good if it's written for young people.\n2) It's about the Holocaust, and I think we've all heard enough about that. The author will probably even focus on colors among the grays, as in \"Schindler's List.\"\n3) I have WAY too many other books to read.\n\nAfter avoiding the book for as long as possible, I sat down, hoping to enjoy it enough to gain some clever comments for the book group.\n\nTurns out, most of my concerns were right. But one other thing was also true: THIS BOOK ROCKS.\n\nThe first thing any review will say about this book is that it is narrated by death. So, I might as well get it out of the way. Death, the Hooded One, the Angel of the Night, narrates. He is very busy during the war years, as you might expect. Some people claim this is a mere gimmick, and that the story is strong enough as it is.\n\nI agree that this is a strong story-- it moves like a sailboat on a brisk day-- but I think the choice to tell it through Death was a good one. Death foreshadows constantly, so we know a bit about which of the characters will die. Instead of ruining the shock value, this heightened my anticipation and dread. And isn't that how people feel during war? They know some of them are bound to die. They know they will lose loved ones. It's one long, hellish wait to see how it will turn out.\n\nIt's also an unusual take on the Holocaust because it focuses on Liesel, an orphaned German girl living in Hitler's birthplace. Liesel (The Book Thief) and the other characters in this book are rich, interesting, and wily. I say wily because at points in the book you hate them, but they change, and you grow to love them. For instance, Liesel's adopted mother is a foul-mouthed, abusive, sharp woman. (SPOILER--->) When Liesel's adopted father is shipped off to war, however, Liesel creeps through the house to see Rosa sleeping with her husband's accordian strapped around her waist. Rosa's changes prove one of the greatest reasons to read good literature-- to get insight into the type of people we don't usually give a second chance.\nShow more",

            "content": "I am apparently one of the few people who just do not see what all of the hype is about on this one. I was really excited to read this after all of the glowing reviews it got, but I was left extremely disappointed. I found the writing stilted and stuttering (hard to stutter in writing, but this book pulls it off), overly sentimental, and heavy-handed on the symbolism.\n\nI also found the author's approach to the story to be just plain gimmicky. The first and foremost gimmick (also see heavyy-handed symbolism) is that the story is narrated by Death. Now, this might work in some books, but not this one. The choice of narrator adds absolutely nothing to the story; it is only a distraction to the reader, and it also encouraged the author to add trite observations about Death's perspective (for example, he doesn't carry a scythe, but likes the human image) that add nothing to the story. If Death here had been given developed personality or a unique perspective, then maybe (and even then it's a stretch) the choice of narrator would have worked. As it is, the story is told almost entirely as though by an omniscient narrator (is Death omniscient?) and we get absolutely nothing from the choice of Death to fill the role. It's a gimmick, and it falls flat.\n\nThe other gimmick I found most distracting (these are not the only two, but they are the most egregious) is the repeated use of little newsflash-type, bold and centered notes that appear periodically through the story to highlight some stupid point and add (in the author's mind) dramatic effect. These newsflashes, as I think of them, were irritating and served only to break up the natural narrative flow without adding anything significant. This is another example of the author hitting the reader over the head with his points, rather than trusting his own writing to get the message across. This is another ill-conceived and heavy-handed gimmick intended to correct for a poor narrative.\n\nI think it is telling that while this book gets listed as teen fiction, Zusak actually wrote it for adults. For some reason, it got identified as being for teens when it got marketed in the U.S. (it was written in Australia). It seems to me that the explanation for this change is that the novel feels like it was written by a very immature author, and so the prose does not attain the quality one should expect of adult fiction.\n\nI think good Holocaust stories need to be told, but the Book Thief fails at that endeavor. The story is trite; the narrative is sentimental and uninspired. I recommend that you look elsewhere for something better. If you want something for younger readers, try Number the Stars, by Lois Lowry. If you're a bit older, also read Night by Elie Weisel or the Diary of Anne Frank. I might even add in Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, to counteract the heavy-handed book-burning theme of the Book Thief. There's plenty more out there that better deserve your time and attention than does this book.\nShow more",

I was looking through my friend reviews hoping that someone would share my opinion - at least a tiny bit - and seeing 5 stars, 5 stars, 4.5 stars, 5 stars...\n\nI can appreciate that is a very talented writer, some of the phrases he uses are beautiful and highly quotable - more reminiscent of poetry than prose. And the story idea? A tale narrated by Death and set in Nazi Germany... original and ominous.\n\nBut it was the story-telling that never really worked for me. This is one of those that are told in a and are meant to cleverly build up a bigger picture...\n\nI could imagine I was reading a collection of short stories (and not a full-length novel) about playground fights, developing friendships, WWI stories and death.\n\nThese stories are supposed to come together and form a novel that is all kinds of awesome, but it was so bland. I also think that can make you want to throw yourself off the nearest tall building... anyone read and spend 99% of it just wishing they'd get to the effin' lighthouse?!\n\nI'm giving this book 3 stars for the pretty words and the concept.

My wife was shedding copious tears as she finished reading the book, and insisted that I read it immediately. How could I not? I was prepared for a moving read and was not disappointed.\n\n\n- from TV Guide\n\nThe main character is Liesel Meminger, just shy of ten years old when we first meet her. It is pre-WW II Germany. Her father has been transported for being a  Kommunist.  While en route with her mother and brother, Werner, to be handed over to foster parents Hans and Rosa Hubermann, her brother dies. At his burial, she retrieves a book dropped by one of the gravediggers, a connection to her brother, and begins her career as a book thief. The Hubermanns live on Himmell (heaven) Street in the town of Molching, outside Munich. Rosa is a coarse, foul-mouthed woman. Hans is a warm, supportive papa. They come to form a very devoted, loving family. The story follows Liesel s coming of age, meeting other children, particularly her bff Rudy, making friends, seeing reflected in the actions of her peers and the events that occur in the town the horrors of the age. But there is much more to this portrait of a German town than the bullies one expects to grow into the expected abusive stereotypes. There is hope, as well, for those who are dragged into the military against their wishes, for those who harbor fugitive Jews at great personal risk, for those who stand up against the abuse of the weak, for those who share a love of knowledge with those eager to learn. There is sadness, as some cannot live with what they have seen, what they have lost.\n\n\n- from Imglist.com\n\nis populated with a klatch of wonderful characters. The spirited Liesel will win your heart, as will her friend Rudy, Hans and even Rosa. There are other characters who will also pluck those strings. You will be rooting for this one or that one, cheering victories and weeping at defeats. Having characters one comes to care for is the greatest strength of this book.\n\nOver all is an appreciation for words, their power for both good and evil, the magic of language, books as a source of both damnation and salvation. Liesel steals her first book as a way of maintaining a connection with her dead brother. Later, learning to read and continuing to steal books gives her a feeling of power. The impact of receives much attention as does book burning.\n\n\n- from Aceshowbiz.com\n\nZusak uses an unlikely narrator for his tale, Death, who speaks to us as a reporter, an observer of events, not as someone who causes death, but as one who gently carries off the souls of those who have passed. While I have no problem with this device, and while I was charmed by the characterization, I was not convinced that it was entirely necessary. One could have just used a more usual third-party narrative to tell the tale. But it is a fun addition nonetheless. The film retained the narrator and did, IMHO, a pretty good job of capturing the essence of the book.\n\n\n- from Hypable.com\n\nZusak takes a lot of stylistic chances here, from his selection of a narrator to the incorporation of a few illustrated tales within the larger whole. They did not all work, but most did, and I appreciated his willingness to draw outside the lines.\n\n\n\n\naccomplishes a very lofty goal. It is both intellectually and artistically daring and satisfying while offering up an emotional punch second to none. It will stimulate your brain and it will, at the same time, steal your heart.\nShow more",

But, like Liesel, words is all I have, so I will have to try.\n\nThis is a lyrical, poignant, heartbreaking, soul-shattering story disjointedly told by a nearly-omniscient, fascinated by humans narrator - Death. (***I must confess that I kept imagining Death as the small-caps speaking Grim Reaper from Pratchett's Discworld, baffled by humans and loving cats and curry. Don't judge me - I needed a glimpse of fun in the bleakness of Zusak's story.*** )\nAnd yet he becomes strangely fascinated with one particular human, the , whose childhood is marked by war, who learns to read and love and treasure books, who has her small rebellions against the force of society, who learns to love and be loved. Because the world is baffling, because it is a cruel place, because often it tries to stomp out love and beauty.\nThe book is with the masterfully written language reflecting the alien, non-understandable, strangely fascinating nature of the narrator - Death. It is the mix of colors and strange metaphors, semi-dictionary entries and frequent strange asides, with skipping time, with\nIt will note the strangest things, ruminate about the weirdest subjects, and casually in the middle of a lyrical passage, omnisciently will tell us that terrible things are about to occur. It is its job to know, after all. And this prescience does not soften the blows when they finally come;\n\n\n\nThis is what the story set against the terrible backdrop of war is about. Zusak accomplished a difficult feat - making me ache for the children of the enemy, the children and people of Nazi Germany, because even when caught in the middle of destruction, even ending up on different sides of artificial barricades people are still people, still deserving of love, still beautiful.\n\n, who were so human that nothing could ever change that., the boy with the , who has so much love and integrity and life\n, who was by Liesel's side since the beginning of their friendship - \" - Rudy, who dreamed about the kiss from Liesel\n\n\n, who possessed so much integrity and courage, who became real parents to Liesel, who risked everything for what they thought was right. , the Jewish fistfighter, who dreamed of battling Hitler and gave Liesel the perfect gift with everything he had.\n\n\nLiesel, who learns more about the cold cruelty of this world than most children should ever know. Liesel, who learns to read from the Gravedigger's handbook, who rescues the book from fire, who would rather steal books than food, who is not afraid to show kindness in the face of very real threat, who finally gives Rudy that overdue kiss, All of them remained human despite the circumstances, despite the pressure to do otherwise, despite anything. And I love them for that.\n\nThis is a wonderful, lyrical, surreal, excellent book that broke my heart into tiny little pieces and yet gave me hope that even in the worst of times we can find beauty.\n\n-----------------\nDISCLAIMER: This is the first review that I've wrote after working four 14-hour days in a row followed by endless reading of textbooks and paperwork, all sore from endless and painful retracting in surgery, having composed this review in my head as a means to not pass out from hunger in the endless surgery.

This book takes such an interesting perspective on a very written about period of history. Having Death as the narrator for parts of the story really took it to the next level; it made it utterly unique. It also created a sense of detachment from the events, and evoked the message that death is unavoidable and will eventually come for all. I loved it, and I think the heroine is just superb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor me, one of the most important aspects of a well written character is someone I can sympathise with and feel vast quantities of empathy for. So, when the protagonist is in love with reading and appreciates the freedom it can grant, I find myself somewhat immediately won over to her cause. Liesel s story is woe begotten and tragic yet she always seems to carry on; she always seems to realise that there are good things in this world. And they re not just books; they re people too. She doesn t give up and fall into a pit of self-pity. You ve got to hand it to her for that. For a young girl she is incredibly strong. She s written so well; it s so easy to invest in her story and wish for her to have an ending she deserves. But, death, by its very nature, doesn t work that way.\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, Death is cold and undiscriminating; he can come at any time and take anyone. I should have known this was going to be a sad one. Death pretty much said so from the start. But one can hope: one can hope that someone who has gone through so much will get a happy ending, though that s not the point of this book. I m saddened by the ending, but it was necessary. This book s impact would have been marginally lessened if the deaths didn t happen at the end. At least Liesel found some degree of comfort, which lifted the veil of misery somewhat. The ending of this book is precisely what made it so powerful. I wouldn t want it s sadness any other way.\n\n\n\nLiesel is an orphan, and when she was adopted I expected her to have an absolutely terrible time. I expected her adopted parents to be awful. This just seemed like the predictable route this story would take, and I m glad it didn t go that way because Liesel learnt the value of human kindness. In the Hubermann household she received warmth and comfort. Hans Hubermann is an excellent man; he is open-hearted and genuine in his affection. He is everything the young orphan needed in a parent, and he is everything that was needed to balance the darkness in the book. He is a true figure of strength and someone who represents the underappreciated resistance to Nazism within Germany during WW2. He refuses to become a member of the political party and even hides a Jew in his basement. He s a good man, a great man.\n\n\n\nHe is Liesel s rock and figure of morale guidance. He s a great character. I know I keep saying that but it is so true. Everything about this book is just brilliant. I think this is such an accomplished story. It takes a lot to write a book like this, and to end it like this. The temptation to end it differently must have been humongous. It s refreshing to see a modern story actually end how it should rather than the easier route of a happy ending. This certainly won t be the last book I ll be reading by Marcus Zusak.\n\n\n\n___________________________________\n\nYou can connect with me on social media via .\n__________________________________\nShow more",

Consistently captivating storytelling, and even sporadically funny at times; with a completely unexpected and devastating ending that I ll never forget, or get over from.\n\n\nA book that for a long time was my very fav No. 1, until I read that is, also by the same author. This book came just at the right time, more than a decade ago when I didn t even know about GR, and picked it up at a local library almost on a whim. And even though I can t stand WW literature nowadays, still remains solidly among my Top 10.\n\nA must read in life. EXTREMELY Recommendable!\n\n*** The Book Thief (2013) is a lovely adaptation. Superbly capturing most of the essence and best highlights of the book. An outstanding performance by Geoffrey Rush, truly deserving of especial recognition; Sophie Nelisse and Emily Watson were awesome too. Very faithful to the book too, and with an alternative, yet still welcomed, ending. 8.5/10. Recommendable! The book won hands down though.\n\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n:\n[2006] [552p] [Historical] [EXTREMELY Recommendable] [ I have hated words and I have loved them, and I hope I have made them right. ]\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n     \n     \n     \n     \n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n1939, Alemania Nazi.

            "content": "\"If you feel like it, come with me. I will tell you a story.\"\n\nI should stop fooling myself thinking that there's ever getting better at bracing through these WWII stories... or any war stories for that matter, whether they are based on real events or completely fictional. But then, they are some of the most important books anyone can ever read, capable change one's whole belief systems and priorities in life while improving the reader's ability to empathize tremendously. For me, The Book Thief turned out to be one such exceptional story.\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to enjoying a story, different readers obviously look for different things from plot to style of writing, complex/ interesting characters, world building, the flow, and many more. What's strange about The Book Thief is, while it has nothing special going on in terms of aforementioned characteristics (may be with the exception of the beautiful writing), the book affects the reader in a most profound way. I believe it's because of the undistorted nature of the underlying story, leading up to a heartbreaking, yet perfectly realistic ending. When you realize the events are not further from the truth, it's quite easy to become overwhelmed with emotions here. But I believe that's the whole point of a story like this.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that doesn't mean the story is lacking in anyway when it comes to characters or storytelling. Though Zusak is not attempting to go out of the way to create and outstanding main character, the realistic development of Liesel Meminger is absolutely beautiful; it's hard not to fall in love with her. The secondary characters are equally wonderful, though that ending makes it all the more difficult to brace against, having being acquainted with them that well.\n\n\n\nOne thing I might not be in the majority here is the narrator, the Death. I didn't hate it by any means, but for me, it didn't seem completely necessary to use such point of view, though I understand the author's intention to introduce a unique perspective. But on the plus side, the reader do get some advance warnings about certain disappointment down the line. It was a little strange at times, coming across those 'spoiler' type warnings, like the ones related to Rudy. At first, I had assumed may be it was the author being considerate, allowing the readers to brace themselves. But the actual ending came with an unbelievable shock, making the warnings about Rudy - though still quite painful - becoming only a fraction of the disappointment. It was an unforgiving , yet very realistic ending.\n\n\n\nThis is the kind of book, which makes one feel like there's not enough stars to do justice. Like I said before, for me, it's not about literary devices when it comes to a book like this. It's all about authentic nature of the story, and the ability to affect the reader in a profound way. The satisfies both of these things perfectly. The Book Thief easily made it to my all-time-favorites and I believe this should be read by everyone. As far as the emotions go, this not an easy read, especially towards the end, but it's worth the effort.\n\n\nBut sometimes, when you come across something like above, no matter how hard you try, there's no alternative but to cry... you wouldn't be able find solace in knowing that this is fiction.\n\nShow more",

            "content": "I had a hardcover of this book. I no longer have it. I did not even finish reading it, because it irritated me so much and when I asked if it got better no one could convince me that it was worth persevering.\n\nI know that there are many people who love this book, authors who's book I love, readers who's tastes I respect. But I couldn't stand the narrator. Every time the Narrator intruded on the story it felt like exactly that--an intrusion. A lot of people really like the narrator, and I imagine if you did the book would be much more enjoyable to read. As it was I found the writing style consciously \"artistic\" or \"literary\" while the characters felt fake, superficial, and mechanical. I was too aware of the mechanics of the story and how he was manipulating the reader--kind of like going to a puppet show and having the puppeteer continually slipping and letting himself be seen. It kept knocking me out of the story.\n\nHolocaust fiction is hard for me to read anyway, because it's an incredibly difficult period of history and human experience to read about. For me to want to read Holocaust fiction, it had better be better than okay, or even good--ti had better be absolutely amazing for me to be willing to put myself through the emotional pain and struggles that are inherent with a holocaust book. Real life is hard enough for me to get upset and stressed out by a mediocre book.\n\nAnd please don't take that to mean that I only read books that are light and fluffy and safe, because I do read books that are hard, that are sad. But while some people same to take pleasure in reading a book just because it is sad (\"Oh, this is a wonderful book! It made me cry!\"), I don't enjoy crying in and of itself. For me to read a book that is heart wrenching, it had better offer me something besides an emotional train wreck--powerful characters I really care about, an engrossing story line, some new observation on human existence and human relations,\n\nI do not usually read fiction to \"learn,\" per se--that is, if I wanted to learn more about the Holocaust, I'd read non-fiction accounts. I have read non-fiction accounts. I have read a few things of Holocaust fiction as well, and I have read some scholarly work as well. So it doesn't sell me on the book that it is a painful story, that it shows that some Germans were good and how social pressures created the Holocaust. I needed it to be a book about people that really interested me, that I cared about, and instead I was bored with the characters and irritated at the narrator and the obvious manipulations of the author. Instead of getting wrapped into the story, every night I when I was reading it I'd throw it down and vent for a half an hour to my husband about something that annoyed me. After a few nights of this, I realized that unless someone could convince me that the second half of the book was much better than the first that it just wasn't worth my time to finish.\n\n'm not saying it's a bad book. So many people wouldn't love it if it were But it really did not work for me.\nShow more",

            "content": "Interesting Premise but Uneven Pacing\n\nThere are tons of books about World War II, and I had high hopes for this book as it was a fictional account, not bound to a concrete set of facts. The Book Thief has a narrator who is Death, and it follows the story of a young German girl named Liesel Meminger.\n\nThe plot was a great concept, but the book didn t live up to its potential. The book was unique in that I hadn t previously read a book about World War II from the perspective of a German citizen. Many characters in the book were children, and it was gut wrenching to experience their innocence evaporate.\n\nHowever, the book had two serious flaws. One, it was really far too long. If I was editing this book, I would take out all of the instances of fistfights. They didn t really move the plot along, and this book was nearly 14 hours long, more than 500 pages. The first 25% and last 25% were riveting, but the middle part kept me nodding off. As for the second flaw, the foreshadowing was far too strong. Now, I do enjoy the occasional well-timed hint or whisper. In this instance, it seemed like constant reminders (both whispers and shouts).\n\n2023 Reading Schedule\nJan Alice in Wonderland\nFeb Notes from a Small Island\nMar Cloud Atlas\nApr On the Road\nMay The Color Purple\nJun Bleak House\nJul Bridget Jones s Diary\nAug Anna Karenina\nSep The Secret History\nOct Brave New World\nNov A Confederacy of Dunces\nDec The Count of Monte Cristo\n\n\nShow more",

I recognize that I am in the minority on this one and that many of my GR friends loved this novel, so there's no need to start screaming at me in the comments. This book just wasn't my cuppa, and that's OK. We're allowed to like different books.\n\nMy List\nI think the thing I hated the most was the writing itself. The sentences were rough, uneven and felt unfinished.\n\nI hated that even though the sentences and chapters were short and choppy, the book was 550 pages long! Two hundred pages could have been cut from this sucker, easily.\n\nI hated how Zusak wrote the narrator Death, and how Death was constantly foreshadowing things. Dude, I get it, you're omniscient.\n\nI hated that Zusak chose to put his cliched story about a girl who likes books against the backdrop of the Holocaust. It seemed like the author was milking a tragedy to try and make his book seem deeper than it is.\n\nI hated that every scene was precious, oh so schmaltzy and precious!\n\nI hated that the characters were all two-dimensional and none of them seemed real. They were just a collection of anecdotes.\n\nI hated that the entire book felt like a pretentious writing exercise by some smarmy grad student.\n\nThis is the second YA novel that I've hated this year, and I'm taking a break from the genre. I don't need books that are dumbed down. I like complex stories and characters, and beautiful writing that makes me want to underline passages. There wasn't a single sentence in The Book Thief that made me pause and appreciate its construction. Not one.\nShow more",

The concept of death narrating the story was eloquently put forward. Often, when you have very high expectations from a book, you may end up getting disappointed. But this book proved to be quite the opposite and I loved it immensely.\n\nThe story follows a nine-year-old girl called who along with her brother , given up by her mother, is taken to a small town called Molching to live with and prior to the events of World War II. During the journey, Werner dies due to mysterious reasons, possibly poverty and poor health and Liesel sets off to bury him. That is when she steals her first book, even though she does not know how to read and it's only the first of what is going to be a series of thefts. She gets accustomed to her foster parents' house despite having nightmares about her dead brother, and eventually learns to read. Her obsession with books intensifies as war closes in and air raids begin- depriving her of people she's grown to love profoundly.\n\nThe book exemplifies the power of words, how they can be beautiful yet exceedingly soul shattering. Liesel is illiterate when she was first taken in, but as she continues to explore the world of reading, she begins to comprehend the impact Hitler's propaganda has and how he is the reason behind her parents' death.\n\n\n\nShe realises how manipulative words can be and tries to right them by writing for commiseration.\n\nOverall, The Book Thief is a poignant and a heart rending tale and it's a surprise I'm still lucid.

They are difficult for me, mostly because I am so dispassionate about them. It s much easier to review something you love, or something you hate, rather than something you ve half-forgotten before you even get to your local library s return box.\n\nSo this book is fine. . It s the story of a young German girl caught in the path of the advancing Nazi regime during World War II. For many German villagers in the late 30s and early 40s, the Third Reich was like a quiet glacier, slowly encroaching on their lives it moved languidly enough that disaster seemed never truly imminent (there is always of time to get out of the way), yet it had enough momentum to churn to pulp anything that was unfortunate enough to meet its frothing jaws.\n\nWhat annoyed me about this book, however, was its distracting style of storytelling. It is told from the point-of-view of the Grim Reaper, the personification of death. I would have actually been okay with this except Death is a grating little sonofabitch. He pretends to keep a distance from the German girl whose story he s telling, representing himself as a disinterested party whose job is simply to harvest souls from their lifeless hosts, but over time he becomes clearly vested in her story, and for this he is a failure. I mean, if death and taxes are the only two things I can count on, and the IRS is a bullshit government arm that can t find its asshole with a flashlight, then I need to be able to depend on Death being a loser.\n\nAdditionally, I specifically detested the\n\n\n\ninterjections, which occur frequently in this novel.\n\nThat said, I think this book is important for its one shining success, which is to remind us that civilian populations of even aggressor countries are innocent victims. Try to keep this in mind the next time your idiot friend says something like,  Dude, we should totally just bomb the fuck out of [insert Middle Eastern country here]. \n\nMy cousin told me I had to review this book or she would sic the Andover Ladies of Literature on me and I wish to scuffle with broads.\nShow more",

            "content": "Very good.\n\nHaving Death as the narrator and having as a central protagonist a young girl in Nazi Germany make The Book Thief by Markus Zusak stand out from the crowd of books about Europe during World War II; this book is good not so much because of the story, but how the author tells it.\n\nIn the Book Thief, Zusak uses a rich, multi-layered blend of allegory, metaphor and symbolism to create amidst the dirt and depression of Germany during the late 30s and 40s a stark vision of historical and philosophical thoughtfulness. This international best seller features a healthy sense of dramatic irony, with the German setting and the strong use of script-like construction becoming reminiscent, vaguely, of , especially the sympathetic depiction of Marxists.\n\nBy using a surreal personification as a narrator, the author has softened the blow of the harsh setting and thus, incredibly, makes the characters more accessible and makes the reader approach an empathy with them that may otherwise be unavailable. I am reminded of Anthony Burgess  comments about and how he created the Nadsat language not just to add depth to his narration, but also to minimize the brutality of his story. In much the same way, Zusak has used Death as a narrator to ironically assuage the viciousness of the everyday life that Liesel and the Hubermanns experience in their quiet section of Nazi extremism.\n\nDeath is not just a narrator but also one of the characters. Telling a story from his vantage, about a group of Germans on Himmel (Heaven) Street amidst the moral flagellation of the Third Reich Zusak creates a fecundity of symbolic structure. I found myself getting lost in metaphoric possibilities. What did he mean by that? What could that symbolize? Yet the author does not over generalize or make universal declarations, his approach is far more subtle, and again Brechtian in it s demystification for dramatic realism; the reader comes to know Liesel Meminger, not as an ultra-real snapshot, nor as a idealized German everygirl, but as an actress in a play, knowable and probable, but still a dramatic portrayal. Through the eyes of Death, Liesel enters from stage left and we follow her through stereotypical misadventures made hackneyed in the World War II genre, but also through the good, the bad, and the ugly that is histrionic enough to be believable and understandable as an expression of real life during Nazi Germany.\n\nThis is still, though, after all, a representative portrayal of an ugly time. The reader should not look for a Disney moment, there are few. Zusak peppers his chronicle with some scenes of comic relief, but he never lets you forget when and where the action takes place. Expectations of Hollywood commercial breaks will come and go unnoticed on this trip; and all to the credit of its creator, who has crafted that most rare of accomplishments: a commercial success and at the same time an artistic expression.\n\nA very singular literary experience and an enjoyable journey with a young writer from whom we have much to expect.\n\nShow more",

            "content": "This is my all time favorite book! I thought Zusak hit it out of the ballpark with this book. It was beautiful, it was sad, it was poetic. It was all things that books should be. It was simply divine. I actually read this very fast and then got mad that I read it so fast because I did not want it to end. I loved the characters. This book made me think, feel, cry and cheer for the characters. There is such beauty in this book. A must read for anyone who loves to read.\n\nThis book is set during WWII Germany and tells the story of Liesel Meminger, a foster girl living outside of Munich. Her younger brother has died and her mother has been \"taken away.\" She has been taken in by a German couple who are scraping out a meager existence. Liesel learns to read with the help of her accordion playing foster father. She develops a love of books and cannot help stealing them when the opportunity presents itself. She forms a closed relationship with the Jewish man hidden in her basement before he is marched to Dachau. Liesel also forms another close friendship with a boy who has hair the color of lemons, Rudy Steiner. Two people who will have an impact on her life. \"The Book Thief\" is narrated by Death. It's an unlikely narrator, but a very appropriate one for a book set during the Holocaust.\n\nSee more of my reviews at\nShow more",

            "content": "Bravo Zusak! A standing ovation, a mighty opus. You stood Death on her head, removing her dark cloak and scythe, clothing her with feeling and letting us see she has eyes to see and a heart to feel, and the intellect to narrate a compelling story. I was so glad to find out she has a womb. Out of Death comes Life. She has greater aplomb than Nick in telling about Gatsby.\n\nIn the spring of 1968 at age 19, I made my way to Dachau. I lived just south of Munich and the visit to the defunct concentration camp had a haunting effect upon me that will last until Death comes for me and, I believe, beyond (but eternity s yet another subject; this story was about life.) I went back to Dachau several times, the souls of the living and the dead calling me. As I worked among Germans in nearby Munich, I was surprised to encounter Jews still, or perhaps again, making their home there, so close to Dachau, so soon after Hitler and his henchmen. These early experiences furnished my life with both angst and vision: with angst to recognize the potential for evil within ever human being and with vision to see the possibility for courage and compassion, to pick up a piece of bread to feed a cipher.\n\nAnd that s a big part of what The Book Thief does for me: it captures and again reminds me of these viabilities as they play out near Dachau in the heart of World War II s Nazi Germany in the lives of Liesel and her contemporaries, alive and dead. Death tells Liesel s tragic yet wonderful story in order to keep memory alive. In the words of Elie Wiesel,  Because if we forget, we are guilty, we are accomplices.  And surely this is Liesel s story not Death s just as Gatsby's isn t Nick s. To remind us to stand up wherever tyranny and power put people down.\n\nZusak took the time and effort to invest the narrative with near perfect words and wonderful sentences and great paragraphs and superb chapters. It would have been too cruel and ironic if the  book thief  had found herself betrayed by the words, sentences, and paragraphs of her story s teller. Flesh fully clothes each character; conflict, action, and suspense oblige the attention of each reader; and the themes are true and consistent throughout, start to finish, and the setting is hauntingly perfect. I hope because of this book I am closer to bending over and picking up some bread to give to a cipher, even if it puts us both at Death s door.\n\nIt is a mighty work.\nShow more",

            "content": "Oh, Book Thief  \n\n\n\nI first picked up this book when I was 15 years old, after I'd been hearing such glowing reviews of it here on Goodreads. I knew next to nothing about it, besides that everyone seemed to love it so much; I recall seeing a conversation where a bunch of people agreed it was the best Young Adult book ever written. And then I pick it up from the library and it has some review on the front from the New York Times or something claiming this book is \"LIFE-CHANGING\" or something like that. So I'm like, \"  Damn. Is it really that good?\"\n\nThat first time I read it, it took me only about two or three days. I devoured it, unable to put it down. And when I came to the ending, all I could do was sit there for like half an hour staring at a wall, because I just felt totally numb afterward. I felt utterly shell-shocked. It was just like:\n\n\n\nI had never read anything quite like it. It amazed me.\n\nUnfortunately, at the time I was really crappy at writing reviews, and all I wrote was like, \"OMG THIS BOOK IS AMAZING AND EVERYONE SHOULD READ IT. IT'S JUST SO GOOOOD. LIKE TOTALLY.\"\n\nAnd well, I still agree with that statement. But now, I'm going to attempt to say it in a more thought-out and coherent manner.\n\nIt had been about five years since I read the book for the first time, and I figured it would be a good idea to read it again. I still remembered it all pretty clearly, and I still considered it one of my all-time favorite books even though I'd only read it once. But I still really wanted to experience reading it again.\n\nI'm very glad I got around to reading it a second time. This time, I read it much more slowly  and even though I definitely appreciated it the first time, I think I appreciated it even more the second time.\n\nFirst of all, the writing in this book is just beautiful. I   just   Markus Zusak. I can't even.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow   HOW. TEACH ME YOUR WAYS. UGH MARKUS ZUSAK.\n\nMARKUS.\n\nZUSAK.\n\n\n\n\n\nFun fact: if you search for images of Markus Zusak, one of the searches Google suggests is \"Markus Zusak shirtless\" (also \"Markus Zusak muscles\").\n\n\n\nSo yeah, the point is that I love Markus Zusak so much that I hate his guts. And it doesn't help that he's also so attractive. Damn it.\n\n\n\nOkay, okay. The jokes aside   I love the way this book is written. The choice to have it narrated by Death is quite an interesting one. The first time I read the book, it was a bit confusing to me at first, and it's the type of choice that could have become very gimmicky. Zusak made quite a risky decision there, but ultimately I think it was a great decision. Death's narration somehow manages to be not too overpowering; after all, most of the story is focused on Liesel. But it also is an important factor of the narration that doesn't get forgotten.\n\nAnd then there are the characters   THE CHARACTERS.\n\n\n\nCan I just get them all together and hug them all?\n\n\n\nDamn it, I'd even hug Death. I'd hug the shit out of them all.\n\nLiesel is such a wonderful and relatable main character. She's by no means a perfect person, which makes her seem like a real young girl. Her love of words is just so tangible and powerful. I think a lot of avid readers can see themselves in her  a girl who would do anything for stories. She's so passionate and smart and sweet and just   ugh. I love her. I don't see how you could read this book and not fall in love with her.\n\nSpeaking of falling in love   Max. Oh my goodness, Max. I just want to marry that guy. He's so wonderful and such a sweetheart and just   aggh.\n\n\n\n\nThe friendship between Liesel and Max is so beautifully done, and something that's pretty atypical for a YA book (or for any book, I guess)   I mean, there's like a 10+ year age difference between them or something, and it could have come off as super creepy, but it isn't at all. It's wonderful.\n\n\n\nOh, and of course there's Rudy. AAAAAHHHhhhh Rudy. He's so freaking adorable and awesome. And   I don't even know what else I can say. Words can't describe my love for that kid.\n\n\n\nAnd Hans! Hans Hubermann! Hans with his accordion and his wonderfulness. He's like my favorite literary dad ever (besides maybe Atticus Finch). The relationship between Hans and Liesel is so adorable. Ahhh   I have no words.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay, I could continue listing every single character in the book and talking about how wonderful they are, and how the characterization of every single one of them is so amazing and wonderful, so that you feel like you live in the same neighborhood as all of them, and yada yada   but I'll just stop there. Basically, the characters in this book are just phenomenal.\n\nOver all, the book just has such a powerful message about how storytelling is what helps us cope with the worst of times  and obviously, the Holocaust was one of the most terrifying periods of history. Although I have certainly never experienced something so traumatic, the book still strikes a personal chord with me  just because it really conveys how books and words are so powerful, and how they can save people's lives.\n\n\nSo   I don't know what else there is to say. After reading this a second time, I can still say that this is one of my favorite books ever. It's just stunning and astounding and beautiful, and I don't even know how to express my adoration of it. As an aspiring YA author, I can only hope that someday I'll be able to write a YA book this amazing. And I can't thank Markus Zusak enough for writing it.\n\nOne little side note:\n\nThere's a movie coming out next year! And I'm super excited. I haven't heard much news about it, but Liesel has been cast. She will be played by a young French actress named Sophie N lisse   who I think has only been in one other (French) movie, so I guess at this point it's difficult to judge her acting ability. However, I think I'm already in love with her, because JUST LOOK HOW CUTE SHE IS. AWWW.\n\n\n\n  Okay, that's all.\n\n(: Yaaaay came out! I'M SO EXCITEDDDD.)\nShow more",

Rudy, who lived a short yet a conquering life. Liesel, the protagonist who understood things so well. Perhaps this why my wife had so big an impact of Markus Zusak's creation of this fictitious character. The Hubermanns had a touching sense about them. The story to me is not heartbreaking but heartwarming.\n\nThe moment Max came out of his hiding, just to watch the sky he has not seen in months, whilst others crouched fearing for their lives: that moved me.

            "content": "This was one of those books that has been sitting on my TBR list forever. Finally, I decided to give it a go. Although it isn't my usual type of book, I found it to be a beautiful story.\n\n'The Book Thief' tells the story of a young girl, Liesel, growing up in Germany during WWII. After the death of her brother, she is put into foster care by her mother. Unlikely as it may seem, she goes on to form a close relationship with her foster father as she grows up in a nation inundated by the Nazi regime.\n\nAlong the way, Liesel forms a friendship with a neighborhood boy, Rudy Steiner. She falls in love with books and takes to stealing during that trying time. In so many ways, her childhood mirrored any other \"normal\" happy childhood. However, the over-bearing presence of Hitler's Nazi influence loomed in the background. The fear and lack of control felt by Liesel and her community was palpable.\n\nWhen her foster parents choose to hide a Jewish man, Max Vandenburg, in their basement, Liesel's story becomes even more complicated. There is no denying the brutal reality of life under the Nazi regime. I held my breath, waiting for their secret to be discovered.\n\nWhile some parts of the story were predictable, given that we all know how WWII ended, other elements of this story surprised me. I had put off reading this story for quite some time because I expected it to be rather bleak. While there were some depressing, gloomy topics that were addressed, I was glad to find that the book did not take on that vibe entirely. Mostly, I found the story to be enlightening and inspirational.\n\nOverall, this was a fabulous book. I can see it becoming a standard \"required reading\" book for school-aged children. It's definitely one that I'll have my daughters read. This was a beautiful story that should serve as a cautionary tale and a reminder to us all.\nShow more",

When he died at the age of 50, Larsson left three unpublished thrillers and unfinished manuscripts for more. The first three books (, and ) have since been printed as the series. These books are all bestsellers in Sweden and in several other countries, including the United States and Canada.\n\nWitnessed a rape when he was 15, and was helpless to stop it. This event haunted him for the rest of his life. The girl being raped was named Lisbeth, which he later used as the name of the heroine on his Millenium trilogy.

            "content": "I've heard and read many complaints about Stieg Larsson's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo:\n\n1. It's misogynistic.\n2. It's packed with clich .\n3. It's too convoluted.\n4. It's too disturbing.\n5. Lisbeth wasn't autistic enough or was foolishly autistic.\n6. There were too many red herrings, and the damn Nazi red herring didn't have the usual payoff.\n7. Too/Two many plots.\n8. Too hard on Leviticus.\n\nI will answer these in a moment, but first I must declare that I am an unrepentant fan of this book. This is one of the rare times when I long for goodreads to have half grades, because I would love to give this 4.5. I can't give it a full 5, though, because I sense Mr. Larsson's series is going to grow in his last two books.\n\nAnd now...back to the top eight complaints:\n\n1. Perhaps, but how can a book whose original Swedish title is \"Men Who Hate Women\" avoid misogyny? It can't. But at least the misogyny present is a comment on misogyny. Larsson isn't being misogynist. He's attacking misogyny.\n\nMoreover, our hero, Mikael Blomkvist, is not one of the men who hate women. He is a pretty good guy, actually; in fact, he's one of the rare guys I would actually categorize as a \"good guy\" in most modern literature. Sure...he's a bad Dad. Sure...he has a failed marriage and many sexual relationships. Sure...he makes some decisions that challenge his ethics. But he remains a \"good guy.\" He tries to do well in an ugly world. He never succumbs to cynicism. And he genuinely cares about all the people in his life. Male and female.\n\nAnd it's not like Berger and Salander are weak women -- far from it. There may be misogyny in , but it is wholly the characters' misogyny -- those who have it -- and not the author's.\n\n2. With apologies to my friend who's first name starts with T: Clich , smich ! Yes there's some clich  -- maybe plenty of clich  -- but who cares?! Seriously? We're not talking about here. We're talking about a mystery novel, a serial killer who-dunnit. Complaining about clich  in is like complaining about \"pinko sympathies\" in .\n\nThere's communism in Marx? Really? You think!?\n\n3 & 7. Yep. There's a couple of distinct plots here, but there's a level of verisimilitude to that. Have even our banal lives ever had anything important happen without something else important occurring at the same time? Not mine, and to have multiple incidents happening simultaneously makes sense to me. The search for Harriet Vanger wasn't hampered at all by the Wennerstr m drama, and vice versa. And to be honest, I loved having a pair of mysteries solved in the same novel.\n\n4. Too disturbing compared to what? It's nowhere near as disturbing as , and it's about average as far as the serial killer genre goes. Plus, I think there is a power in the graphic moments of this novel, particularly Lisbeth's vengeance on her guardian. I am not on her side when it comes to this vengeance, but I understand it, and the drive to take vengeance in such a way -- such a human way -- fascinates me. Who'd have thought, besides maybe my friend Manny, that the Swedes have it in them?\n\n5. Perhaps this is true, but at this point I have only read one of the trilogy, and the only person who suggested that Lisbeth was autistic was Mikael, and while he thought she was suffering from Asberger's his guess was only in passing. I can cut the book some slack here. (suspend my disbelief, suspend my disbelief).\n\n6. I was stoked that, for once, the Nazis were a red herring rather than the ultimate, degenerated evil. We all expect the Nazis to be the worst of the worst, so it is refreshing to see them as a deflection instead.\n\n8. Can anyone really be too hard on Leviticus? Ummmmm...nope.\n\nNow, I admit that I might love this novel simply because it is set in Sweden. After all, I do love ABBA, Fredrik Ljungberg, IKEA (my apologies), gl gg, Stellan Skarsg rd, Max von Sydow, Ingmar Bergman, and Mats Sundin. I looked into emigrating to Sweden but had no excuse, being a resident of Canada with no skills the Swedes were looking for, and I am a fan of Norse Mythology, but I do love Sweden, and I was jazzed by the setting of 's book. All that aside, however, I think was a compelling, entertaining and unabashedly thrilling read.\n\nIf you can overlook the eight complaints, or consider them in a different light, you'll like this book too. I promise.\nShow more",

            "content": "I really don't understand the critical orgasms over this book. Amazon pushed it on me for weeks, and the minute I stepped into Borders an employee ran over and recommended it. Thinking, this really better be the best book I've ever read, I took it up to the checkstand, where the register guy asked: \"Did one of our employees recommend this?\" Um, yeah. And Amazon, too. So of course I asked him why.\n\n\"Oh,\" he replied, \"we've been told to recommend it this week.\" That should have tipped me off right there: recommendations handed down by management. Pfft. I hesitate to suggest a conspiracy, but - did someone end up with too many of these in a warehouse in Duluth? Did Oprah make a bet with someone that she could pull strings and make the most boring book in the world a best seller?\n\nBut I am suckered in by numerous good reviews and a fairly interesting book jacket description, so I buy it and take it with me on a trip camping with my family. Of course it totally sucks. I'm kicking myself because I feel like I really should have known. But the reviews - ALL the reviews - are absolutely positive from generally reliable sources, so I just DO. NOT. UNDERSTAND.\n\nHere's why I don't like it: I am about a third of the way into it, and literally hundreds of characters have been introduced. NOT ONE of them has done anything interesting, so I am finding it nearly impossible to keep them straight. I am the type that will be more or less satisfied reading the back of a cereal box, but this is BAD. I mean bad. The mystery is dull. The who done it is more like a who cares. The two primary characters are so far not very likable at all - in fact, the review descriptions are more interesting than the book descriptions of them. I'm betting part of the problem is the translation, presumably - but god, there is just some boring writing in here, too. \"He went to the store. He bought milk. He was cold. He went home.\" - BOR-RING! I am not really exaggerating, either.\n\n\nActual content:\n\"He put on a pot of coffee and made himself two sandwiches. He had not eaten a proper meal all day, but he was strangely uninterested in food. he offered the cat a piece of sausage and some liverwurst. After drinking the coffee, he took the cigarettes out of his jacket pocket and opened the pack.\"\n\nAgain, I'm willing to give the author the benefit of the doubt with the translating, but I wouldn't have gotten out of high school writing with that kind of boring and utterly pointless description. It sets the tone of \"lonely dude being lonely\" but really: two sandwiches? why two? sausage and liverwurst - fascinating.\n\nThat's really just a page I opened to randomly - there is much worse. I am truly bitterly resentful of every minute I am stuck on the side of this mountain without a good book to read. I'm ready to browse the mini mart down the way and read the real estate magazines instead. Why have all the reviewers and Amazon steered me SO WRONG???\n\nI am not trying to insult anyone's taste - so please don't get mad about my opinion. But if you love this book, please - tell me WHY. What am I missing?\n\n\n\nShow more",

            "content": "Swedish people are nuts! I realize that s a bit of a broad generalization and it sounds a bit rude, but I don t care. Because more often than not, I m nuts too.\n\nI was born and raised in Minnesota, and if you know our state history, you re already aware that we were predominantly settled and populated by Swedish (and Norwegian) immigrants. So not only are many Minnesota residents of Scandinavian descent, myself included, a lot of our quirky mannerisms and even our accents are commonly attributed to this influence. I attended a Swedish Lutheran college (which attracted a lot of Swedish exchange students). And one of my oldest and dearest friends is an American by birth but was raised in Sweden and didn t return to live full-time in the U.S. until she was 18. She s always found Minnesotans to be a very interesting form of science experiment what happens when you mix Swedish and American culture anyway?\n\nTaking what I know firsthand of Minnesota culture into consideration, I can only assume that Sweden, aka the motherland, is also a twisted place of dark, dry humor. Some mainstream examples that support this claim would include: Fargo, Drop Dead Gorgeous, A Prairie Home Companion and yes, even Mr. Purple Rain himself, who even though he s genetically a bit more exotic than a plain old Swede, definitely displays some of the more oddball (but typical) Minnesota traits in his own special way.\n\nThe point being, the characters in this book felt oddly familiar to me, quirks and all. I m actually a bit surprised I loved the book as much as I did because I normally criticize authors for trying to jam too much into one story and this book had going on:\n\n--shady business dealings\n--corporate fraud\n--murder\n--religious fanaticism\n--extramarital affairs\n--Nazis\n--casual sex\n--creepy pervs\n--violence against women\n--money laundering\n--sexual sadism\n--political proselytizing\n--dysfunctional family secrets\n\nAnd that s just scraping the surface. Because once Larsson got into it and started digging deeper into the plot and revealing more details, my head started spinning and I had smoke coming out of my ears. I wasn t expecting to be sucked in so quickly by the plot and am still reeling over the fact that this brick-like book (my copy has nearly 600 pages) went as quickly as it did.\n\nI just reserved the sequel from the library and am also excited at the prospects of a third. I m also sad that Mr. Larsson passed away. What a talented author not many could tie so much crazy shit into one story and still have it make sense AND be entertaining.\n\nAlthough I think whoever decided to change the title when they released this book in English is nuts too. The original Swedish title, Men Who Hate Women, is much more fitting.\nShow more",

Read up until the financial scam and lost interest (DNF).\n\nLearned that this was my grandfather's fave book. I wanted to have something in common with him so I reluctantly picked it up.\n\nI listened to the audiobook and became engrossed in the mystery but frequently lost track of who was who. I'm still glad I tried it because it gave me something to write to him about in the weekly letters.\n\nIt's been a bit over a year since my grandfather passed and I just felt like I needed to read it again.\n\nReading this book for the third time just blew my mind. It's partly because I was constantly reminded of him and partially because I'm familiar enough with the plot/characters that I can pick up on all the things I missed earlier. It's been a bittersweet reread.\n\n\n\n\nRead by Simon Vance and he was just the absolute perfect voice for this book. Really, truly a great listen.\n\n| | | | | Snapchat @miranda_reads\nShow more",

            "content": "WARNING! This is going to be a long TED Talk because:\nI could talk about this book all day without breathing pauses and I d still not finish everything I want to say about it.\n\n4.45/5   for this one because I couldn't convince myself to give it 5 stars, no idea why though.\n\n  \n\n\nAs Dragan Armansky felt in that particular moment about Lisbeth Salander, I felt that about her the whole book. And I must say that I liked feeling that way about her. That means that she has some sort of wilderness in her personality that makes her so interesting, not only as a character but also as a possible real-life person.\n\nmade me ascend through different stages while reading it. I rarely find a book like this one, to make me feel all sorts of feelings towards it, from all the levels of human sensitivity in thinking. If I d have to layer the stages of my process of reading this book, probably it would go like this:\n\n1)\nI was extremely confused with the beginning. I think I had to read it at least five times to actually get a grip of the story in the beginning. Maybe it is because I was briefly introduced in the middle of a scene with unknown characters and undiscovered plot. I don t know, but I had a hard time with it anyway.\n\n2)\nI ve had a hard time convincing myself that this book deserves to be read because of the epic state of boredom that I encountered. I spent two hours reading without stopping only to find out I ve made only 4% progress (yes, I read it on my tablet because I don t have enough finances to buy all the books I want and also survive as a student who is away from home and also likes to eat). I kept asking myself what was this bug of boredom that I had and then it hit me. TOO MUCH ECONOMIC TALK. As a student at the Academy of Economic Studies, my interest should ve been aroused. Even more   as I study Business Administration, all the business talk should be some delicious dessert for me. But NA-AH. I am bored enough by the countless hours of business terminology, ideology and any other  ology that shit implies, I don t need to read about it in my spare time too. But hey, why not creeping some of that in my casual reading to keep the brain on its right track of self-destruction, ?\n\n3)\nAfter about 100 pages (I reckon even more) something started working for me. The mystery started to crawl at the surface so I could see and touch it and also expect more and more. Then, the author added some interesting family dirt (that I absolutely love, don t judge me, I have a weird family too, amazingly weird, if I may add, but still weird) and also some World War 2 references (all these besides the actual mystery of Harriet Vagner s disappearance and also possible murder). I don t know what happened from that moment on, but it started being good. Like really good. It s just you can feel the mystery, especially because the book gives you almost 0.1 details about the possible murder. Your inner Miss Marple must be intrigued. Mine was for sure.\n\n4)\nSince now, I haven t talked much about the eponym of the book, right? Well, let me talk then. . And the surely nauseous manner in which she was treated. How do you expect anyone with at least a bit of empathy and humanity not to be OUTRAGED and DISGUSTED by the rape scenes which Lisbeth has been put through? It is absolutely indisputable, morally wrong and socially disgraceful. I am going to be very mean and very direct and I am going to ask a question: What level of psychical constipation do you need to have to pursue such an abominable act?\nYeah, those passages made me very sick. And very sad. Truly. I felt nauseous after all. But then \n\n5)\nLisbeth Salander is a bloody queen and you can t make me change my mind even with an AK-47 glued on my temple. She s ice cold, but she s breathing fire. She s the fool of the village, but she s the hero of the nation. She s invisible, but she s not transparent. The way she seems not to care about anything that may interfere with her principles and also the way she cares about things but never speak them up is just so , so part of the true individual she is, even though she might look unrealistic constructed. You do you, girl. You do you.\n\n\n\nThe fact that, until the middle of the book, Salander and Blomkvist didn t meet and also  the girl with the dragon tattoo  was reduced only to a few scenes made me question my reading choice. I was on board only for Salander, because she captured my interest from the first time she appeared in scene. But then, Pippi Longstocking and Kalle Blomkvist merged together and gave life to this fabulous Swedish detective dream team and I was down for it.\n\nTalking about the characters of the book, the female characters were such it felt so good reading about them (super businesswomen taking over multinational companies? Yeah, okay, sign me up). I couldn t feel any real connection towards the however, except for Mikael Blomkvist. Even though he is a lousy father and husband and he has some shaky ethics in life, he is definitely a good man by his nature. Yes, he has his own issues, but who doesn t? Yes, he was having a not so secret love affair with his best friend and business partner, Erika Berger, but as long as they didn t make a secret out of it and people in their lives accepted it, I can t say that it is punishable.\nAnd, also, because we are still on the topic: Erika Berger. I absolutely loved her. She is a witty businesswoman, with a lot of gut and a lot of cold blood to make decisions and to run her own world. She s a strong woman who makes her own living out of her own life and enjoys it as it is, never letting anyone getting to her with some second-hand crap.\n\n. The most important character of all, the one that I absolutely loved beyond any other character is ladies and gentlemen *drum rolls* yes, you're right, Lisbeth Salander!\nI can t tell you I feel this way about Salander, but she was my absolute favourite since the very first moment I met her. The passive way that she adopted, the cold feelings that she spread, the taciturn nature and her absolutely killer mind just had me on board. Everyone saw Salander as a victim of society, but I felt that was wrong. I have never had that feeling about her. She always inspired me survival. She was a fighter by nature and fighters always survive. And this is how Salander made her way through life. Also, let s be honest now, she has a killer T-Shirt taste, like seriously badass (see and ).\n\nIn conclusion, this book gave me such a hard time I cannot explain, but it was also a really good book that I might consider as one of my own personal favourites. Also, as a side note: has anyone notice how much coffee do those people drink?? Or is just me?\nAll in all people, good reading!\n\nShow more",

            "content": "Women are raised to routinely fear rape.\n\n If you go at night, take a friend.   Check under the car and in your backseat before you get in.   I m just saying it s a good idea to know where the exits are.   I got you this whistle for your keychain, you know, just so you have it.   You were an hour later than I thought you d be! We called the police!   Oh, that s pepper spray; I keep it with me just in case.   I just make sure I get my keys out and check for other weapons if I m getting off work late.   Is this weird? I live alone and I m going running, so if I don t call you by 11:15, call the police, okay? \n\nA woman who fights back   no, a woman who argues at all   does so knowing it will probably make her a social pariah.\n\n She s just one of those women who makes life hell . . . like a Hillary Clinton type.   You re different; you re not a ball buster like some girls.   You know that rape accusations can destroy a man s life, right? And when she said it, did you see how she looked? I mean . . .   All girls do is complain and nag. Not you, of course   most girls.   But it is really women who are the privileged ones to be covered and cared for by the man; all of the responsibility for decisions are on him.   He didn t mean it the way it sounded, so you'll just regret it if you tell him he's wrong.   She never understood me, and now she s making all of these claims and trying to take practically half of my paycheck. I think she was just in it for the money in the first place.   All I said was she has a nice rack; what a bitch.   That s just life; make the best of it. \n\nAnd there is good reason we are raised to fear rape, and raised not to fight back: survival. Women know that if we walk alone in the dark, statistically there is a good chance we will get raped. If we go to the wrong party, we ll be raped. If we misread that boy next door and his swellness is a con, rape. And when a person is in a position of being systematically controlled, it often does cause more physical or emotional damage to fight back. It s not right, but it is realistic.\n\nIt seems to me like it is the equivalent of every man being raised that if he leaves the house at the wrong time, he might encounter a woman who will strip him naked, hold him down, and knee him in the balls while she masturbates. And then in this alternate universe, these boys find out, as they grow up, that most of the men they know have had that happen to them. And I m not trying to minimize sexual assault experiences that involve little or no physical injury, nor am I trying to minimize sexual assaults against men: no one has the right to touch another person s body without permission. I m talking about the way women are raised to think of daily life. Women are not raised to be afraid we re going to get a super hot BJ that we didn t realize we wanted, which is sometimes how I feel people talk about rape accusations. We are raised to encounter our daily lives knowing that, even if violence wasn't in our past, violence probably is in our future. And every time someone says,  Don t go alone,  it is a little reminder that a lot of men hate us.\n\nI have to say, though, that while I think it is realistic to say that women are raised to fear rape and to incorporate that fear of rape into our daily routine, and that sometimes fighting back makes things more dangerous, I do not believe it is effective to live in fear or to encourage women to live in fear or not defend ourselves. I think that perpetuates an idea that women are powerless, which then encourages women to freeze up when encountered with violence or even conflict. I think is probably more productive.\n\nAnd teaching men not to rape.\n\nThat seems like the approach this book takes, though it more directly simply reflects, with appropriate outrage, on the levels of male contempt for women. And I think in that way, in the way it is directed to men, it is about how gross contempt for women is, whether it takes the form of self-absorption or sadism.\n\nThis book is smart. It is symmetrical in its execution in many ways: in starting and ending with Blomkvist s corporate corruption story, and in the way it shows men and women accused of race whoring, men and women subjected to violence. The juxtaposition of\nis really well played. It is viscerally grotesque in the contrast, and it highlights the theme of consent. It was physically difficult for me to read, especially in the contrast, and I thought that made it very effective.\n\nSalander s character, too, is smart. She is both the outcast that women are when we fight back, and she is something of the misunderstood-bad-boy hero turned girl. I liked that. When she\n. It bothers me when a storyteller starts to let a girl save a guy, but really she only tosses him the gun to save himself. Salander gets some real action and some real credit, and it is satisfying.\n\nUltimately, it is pretty clear, but not laughing in your face, just resigned, Larsson knows\n. The hatred we condemn in this book, though, manifests as violence, and I can get behind featuring that and then fading out to Cicilia s father condemning her as a whore and Blomkvist s blissful self-absorption. It is a meaningful gradation. But, it is important that\n. And, aren t we all assholes to each other a lot of the time? But not all of us get off on kneeing each other in the balls.\n\nThis struck me as a very masculine translation of male hatred of women and the way women navigate a world that tells us every time we turn a corner that it hates us. It seems like men either have considered what life would be like if they had been trained to fear leaving the house after dark, or they haven t. And in my experience, it is difficult for men to understand a woman s words if she tries to describe it, so I think it is important to have a man tell a story this way. I do see how the graphic descriptions of sadistic violence against women might allow a sadistic audience to read only for that, but the fact that Larsson balances this with graphic violence against men neutralizes the gender-hatred aspect of that to me. And if you are reading these books for the violence, see a psychiatrist, but I don t think it is productive to censor descriptions of violence just because someone fucked up might get off on them. And if you think these descriptions are fantastical exaggerations, go spend some time at your local women s shelter. Unfortunately, I think you will find you are wrong. And I don't think it does anybody any good to be afraid to tell these stories.\n\n\n\nI hated the writing in this book a lot. Like, I hated it a lot. It both hit a lot of pet peeves of mine and it was just objectively bad in a lot of places. I don t have a problem with books being badly written if the writing doesn t get in the way of a good story, but here the writing was waiving its hands in my face the whole time trying to get me to lose the story. The sandwiches! OH TEH SANDWICHES! I wonder how much tourism for Sweden Larsson drummed up by the sandwich descriptions. I hope none because gag. I can see how he created the effect of an investigatory report through the writing, so, I think it is intentionally the way it is, but it was a choice I did not enjoy at all. So, overall this was a very unpleasant book to read, but it was smart, and its smartness outweighed its unpleasantness in my evaluation.\n\nIt is always kind of a funny experience to read your own words as someone else would write them. In every Willa Cather novel I have read, there has been a moment where I ve read something and thought,  I just said that last week!!!  It was funny in : I wanted to high five Salander all the time because I would think her dialogue right before I read it. I imagine everyone in the world has told me to read this book because of the times I say,  Oh, another man who hates women.  Or that it is bullshit to say someone had a violent childhood, so of course he had to be violent against women as an adult. So, it was funny to read somebody else say those words. At the same time, Salander felt like a man recording the facts of what he saw a woman do and say once, not like a living, breathing human character. That doesn t take away from the smartness of the book, but it is another reason my actual enjoyment factor was low.\n\nAlso, I had to go buy pickles yesterday because reading about so many of them gave me a craving. I hope Larsson s estate got some sponsorship money from the sandwich and pickle lobbies.\nShow more",

            "content": "After having leaped onto the bandwagon with the rest of everyone, I feel a certain amount of pretentious indie pride saying that I wasn't as awed by this book as everyone else apparently was. Which is not to say that the book wasn't enjoyable and exciting; it just didn't knock my socks off whilst simultaneously blowing my mind and rocking my world. (that sounds like either some great song lyrics or a very complicated sexual maneuver. Let's go with the first option.)\n\nSo, the good stuff: the main story - a disgraced journalist is hired by a rich old man to write a book about said man's crazy rich family, while secretly working to discover truth behind the disappearance and supposed murder of the man's granddaughter. Also in play is Lisbeth Salander, a freelance investigator who also happens to be one of the best hackers in Sweden. She also happens to be , but I'll get to that later.\nThe journalist is investigating a supposed murder (a body was never found, so no one even knows what happened to the girl), so violence is expected. I just wasn't quite prepared for just how intensely graphic the violence is. There's a lot of stuff dealing with assault, rape, and murder of various women. There is also a lot of sex in the book, and the stuff that gets described in the most detail is definitely not consensual and will probably make you very uncomfortable. You've been warned.\nThe investigation itself is pretty fascinating, implausible as it is that some random guy investigating a disappearance that took place 40 years ago was able to find out completely new leads that weren't found by the police or the girl's grandfather (who's been obsessing about the case since forever), but I digress. The family itself is equal parts interesting, creepy, and frustrating. It's not until the journalist (Blomkvist) teams up with Lisbeth that things get really interesting, and they made such a fun team I wanted them to get their own detective show.\nThe book deals mainly with crimes against women and those who commit them. Larsson obviously feels very passionately about this subject, as well as what should be done with the men who assault women. Without giving anything away, rest assured that every bad guy rapist/murderer/whatever gets a large helping of tasty justice.\n\nAnd now for the bad stuff:\n-There's a lot of nattering on about business and computers and journalism and more business stuff that either bored me or went over my head completely.\n-Larsson cannot seem to decide whether he wants to refer to people by their last name or their first name, so he switches back and forth and it is confusing.\n-A family tree is provided at the beginning of the book, since the family the journalist is investigating (the Vangers) is pretty big, but I never had much trouble keeping everyone straight. A map of the island the family compound is located on would have been much more helpful, since I never really figured out the geography of the place.\n-Pointless details. I don't need to know what the characters ate for every single meal, I don't need to know exactly what model of computer/motorcycle/car a character uses, and I don't need to know what each character is wearing at every moment of the day. Larsson is especially guilty of this when Lisbeth is concerned - I guess he decided we wouldn't understand what a unique counterculture tough chick she is unless we know that she's always wearing leather jackets, boots, torn jeans, and black t-shirts with angry slogans. (yes, Larsson actually tells us what each of Lisbeth's t-shirts says.) Listen, Stieg: Lisbeth is awesome. She is wonderfully defined simply through her own actions and thoughts - we don't even need the other characters constantly reminding us how antisocial and tough and uncommunicative and badass she is. Show don't tell etc.\n\nTo sum up, I'm going to give the last word to the book itself, and quote a sentence that's actually a character talking about a book featured towards the end of the story - but it could easily describe Larsson's book:\n\"It was uneven stylistically, and in places the writing was actually rather poor - there had been no time for any fine polishing - but the book was animated by a fury that no reader could help but notice.\"\n\nThat, in a nutshell, was how I felt about\n\nUPDATE: I just watched the film version of this book (the original Swedish one, thank you verra much), and am adding this to my \"the movie is better\" shelf. Not that the book isn't good; it's just that the movie streamlines the story and gets rid of everything I complained about earlier in this review. In the movie, all the minor characters and business-drama babble has been eliminated, Erika and Mikael's weird three-way relationship is thankfully unmentioned, Mikael never boffs Cecilia Vanger, and Noomi Rapace is as Lisbeth I can't even handle it. I'm also pretty sure they took some stuff from and put it in the movie, because there's some stuff about Lisbeth's past that I don't remember from the book.\n\nUPDATE UPDATE: Having now seen the American remake, and re-watched the Swedish version, I have come to a following decision. While the American version is, in a technical sense, a better movie (Fincher is a much better director - for just one example, the scene where Henrik Vanger explains the circumstances of Harriet's disappearance is a masterful example of show-don't-tell), I dislike the changes they made to the ending, and I simply cannot accept Rooney Mara as Lisbeth. Although I'm proud of Fincher & Co. for making her look and act as weird as the character should, something about her portrayal still wasn't right. If you're interested, explains pretty much every complaint I have about American Lisbeth.\nShow more",

Her father, a former newspaper editor and proprietor, was a lawyer who served on the state legislature from 1926 to 1938. As a child, Lee was a tomboy and a precocious reader, and enjoyed the friendship of her schoolmate and neighbor, the young Truman Capote.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in Monroeville, Lee enrolled at the all-female Huntingdon College in Montgomery (1944-45), and then pursued a law degree at the University of Alabama (1945-50), pledging the Chi Omega sorority. While there, she wrote for several student publications and spent a year as editor of the campus humor magazine, \"Ramma-Jamma\". Though she did not complete the law degree, she studied for a summer in Oxford, England, before moving to New York in 1950, where she worked as a reservation clerk with Eastern Air Lines and BOAC.\n\nLee continued as a reservation clerk until the late 50s, when she devoted herself to writing. She lived a frugal life, traveling between her cold-water-only apartment in New York to her family home in Alabama to care for her father.\n\nHaving written several long stories, Harper Lee located an agent in November 1956. The following month at the East 50th townhouse of her friends Michael Brown and Joy Williams Brown, she received a gift of a year's wages with a note: \"You have one year off from your job to write whatever you please. Merry Christmas.\"\n\nWithin a year, she had a first draft. Working with J. B. Lippincott & Co. editor Tay Hohoff, she completed in the summer of 1959. Published July 11, 1960, the novel was an immediate bestseller and won great critical acclaim, including the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1961. It remains a bestseller with more than 30 million copies in print. In 1999, it was voted \"Best Novel of the Century\" in a poll by the Library Journal."

            "content": "/// gentle reminder that this is not the time to read this book ///\n\nThis is my first re-read of 2017, and I don't regret it one bit. When I first read this book three years ago, I really liked it. Sadly, I didn't write my thoughts down in an elaborate way back in the day, but I know for sure, that I didn't read critically then. Upon my re-read of this book, I honestly don't have good things to say. I am aware that some of my criticism is not a critique of the book itself, but about its perception, and how it is, up to this day, held up as the one true book about race relations in the United States of America.\n\nAnd that really infiruates me. This book was written by a white woman, from a white perspective, about white characters, for a white audience. This book is a pat on the back for the white middle class. This book gives comfort to the white middle class. Comfort that they, especially back in the 1960s, didn't need, and allow me to be so bold, didn't deserve.\n\nHarper Lee's focus is purely white. While the white characters in this book are the subjects, who take action into their own hands, who suffer and make sacrifices, the Black characters in this book are objects. They have little to no agency. Things happen to them. They are harmless, defenseless, and just there   waiting for the white knight hero, Atticus Finch, to save them. This book is a disgrace in the face of the Black liberation movements that existed back in the day, and the solidarity within Black communities. Black people stood up for themselves and fought for their rights, and only due to their voices, their protests, their sit-ins, their marches, their demonstrations, their conferences, was racial segregation made unconstitutional in the United States.\n\nBlack people, back then and now, know And because no one put in better words than the one and only James Baldwin, I will quote a passage from one of his amazing interviews on the Dick Cavett Show in 1968. One could say that this is Baldwin's response to the cry of \"not all white people\":\nThis right here is what I'm talking about. plays into this idealism. Although the book touches on the horrors of racism in the Deep South, it s a strangely comforting read. A terrible injustice is done, but at the end the status quo is reassuringly restored. The final message is that most (white) people are nice when you get to know them.\n\nAs a reader you are never allowed to feel with Tom Robinson, the Black man who is innocently convicted for raping a white woman, because all the Black characters in this tale are sidelined. This story should be about them, because how else would you be able to convince the white moderate (in the 1960s) that Black people are actually . The closest insight we get to a Black character is the family's cook Calpurnia. Calpurnia is in the fictional tradition of the \"happy black\", the contented slave   the descendent of the ever-loyal Mammy in . And the rest of the Black community is depicted as a group of simple, respectful folk   passive and helpless and all touchingly grateful to Atticus Finch   the white saviour. We never see any of them angry or upset. We never see the effect of Tom Robinson s death on his family up close   we don't witness Helen, Tom's wife, grieving and Scout never wonders about his children. Their distress is kept at safe distance from the reader.\n\nI was very angry after finishing this book, and I'm still angry up to this day. Not necessarily at Harper Lee, but at our society as a whole, and at our educational system. Why do we constantly uplift white narratives, whilst brushing over marginalized ones? Why aren't our kids reading by James Baldwin   a book dealing with the exact same topic (a Black man getting falsely accused of raping a woman)? Why isn't Lorraine Hansberry required reading? Why are we still relying on white narratives, when talking about Black people and their struggles?\n\nSince finishing this book, I started reading and I wanted to share some interesting facts, because I couldn't believe how absurd was. This story is, supposedly, set in the Deep South in the 1930s, where Atticus Finch, our white saviour, takes it upon himself to defend a Black man at court. By the end of Lee's novel we are led to believe that Atticus had a great chance of actually getting Tom Robinson acquitted, if the latter had just been a \"good n*gger\" and didn't try to escape on his own. (Yes, I'm a little petty. I swear, I'm not turning bitter over this.) So, I just wanted to know how realistic that scenario is. All of the information is related to the 1930s Southern setting. Here's what I've learned:\n\nMost Southern lawyers readily accepted Black clients for routine economic cases   property, tort, contract, dept, insurance   and minor criminal cases that did not threaten the South's system of racial hierarchy. or a politically charged case that in any way challenged segregation.\n\nOnly the combination of direct action, community organizing and legal strategy with the help of lawyers, made the defense of Black men and women at court possible. In the Lockett-case, the Black community in Tulsa survived largely because Black lawyers were able to defend the community's interests. In 1934, Black lawyers represented George Crawford, a Black man accused of brutally murdering a wealthy white woman   . In the end, Crawford got a sentence of life imprisonment instead of a death sentence. And this verdict had to be seen as an accomplishment by the Black lawyers and the Black community as a whole, because life imprisonment was as good as it was going to get.\n\nOftentimes, Black lawyers took serious criminal cases without a fee or at a very reduced rate. This was well appreciated by their communities, but also a given. It is admirable how well Black communities were organized. None of that got translated on the pages of Lee's novel. The Black characters do absolutely nothing, except sending Atticus food, because they're so grateful. [*insert snort here*]\n\nThis book appears to uphold the standard of racial equality; de facto it is about the white middle class patting themselves on the back for not thinking racist thoughts. I'm sorry to break it to you, Miss Maudie, but you won't get a sugar cookie for that. I am not saying that this is not a realistic portrayal of the white middle class, it is, it totally is. If you do just a little research on the Civil Rights movement, the moral apathy of the white middle class becomes crystal clear. However, we shouldn't portray these characters in a positive light, there is nothing admirable about them. After all...\n\n\nShow more",

I know I am risking a serious  FILM AT 11  moment and a club upside the head from Captain Obvious for voicing this, but nabbit dog I still think it needs to be said TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is one of the BEST and MOST IMPORTANT American novels ever written. Okay, I said it, and I will wait patiently while you get your DUHs and DERs out of the way and hang your  no shit  signs outside for Inspector Holmes.\n\nOkay, now given the gruntload of reviews/ratings this book has I know I m not the first person to wag my chin about how amazing it is. Still, I am going to chance coming off like that annoying dingleberry at the tail end of a huge porcelain party because I truly have a pile of love for this book. So if my review can bring a few more people into the Atticus Finch Fan Club, I will be just flush with happy.\n\nOn one level, this book is a fairly straight-forward coming of age story about life in a small Alabama town during the Great Depression. It has a very slice of lifesaver warmth and simplicity to it that I think resonates with a lot of readers. It certainly does with me and I think the adjective  charm  may have been invented to describe the novel.\n\nDespite how easing flowing the narrative is, this book is both extremely and deceptively powerful in its discussion of race, tolerance and human decency. Most importantly, this book shows us by example the courage to stand all up in the grill of injustice and say  Not today, Asshole! Not on my watch. \n\nThat is a lesson that I think we can never be reminded of too often. When bad people do bad things to good people, the rest of us good people need to sack up and be counted regardless of how scary it might be. Easier said then done, I know. But at least that should be the standard to which we strive.\n\nAtticus Fitch is the epitome of that standard. He is the role model to end all role models and what is most impressive is that he comes across as such a REAL person. There is no John Wayne/Jack Bauer/Dirty Harry cavalry charging BSD machismo about him. Just a direct, unflinching, unrelenting willingness to always do what he thinks is right. As Atticus  daughter Scout puts it so well:\nI was to make something crystal before going on because it is an important part of my love of this story. Notwithstanding this book's powerful, powerful moral message, it never once ever comes off as preachy or heavy handed. There is no lecture to be given here. The only sermon we are privy to is the example of Atticus Finch and the simple yet unwavering strength and quiet decency of the man. Even when asked by his daughter about the horrendous racism being displayed by the majority of the townsfolk during a critical point in the story, Atticus responds with conviction but without:\nThis is a special story. Oh, and as a huge bonus it is also an absolute joy to read. Lee s prose is silky smooth and as cool as the other side of the pillow. Read this book. Read it with your children, read it with your spouse, read it by yourself .read it the bigoted assclown that you work with or see around the neighborhood Just make sure you read it. It is a timeless classic and one of the books that I consider a  life changer.  6.0 stars. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!!!!\n\nBONUS QUOTE: This is Scout talking to Atticus after getting to know someone she had previously be afraid of:\n\n(Emphasis added)\nShow more",

            "content": "Why is it when I pick up To Kill A Mockingbird , I am instantly visited by a sensory memory: I m walking home, leaves litter the ground, crunching under my feet. I smell the smoke of fireplaces and think about hot cider and the wind catches and my breath is taken from me and I bundle my coat tighter against me and lift my head to the sky, no clouds, just a stunning blue that hurts my eyes, another deep breath and I have this feeling that all is okay.\n\nWhy? Why this memory? I mean, this takes place in and mostly in the summer, well there is that one climatic scene on Halloween, but I bet it s still hot enough to melt the balls off a brass monkey.\n\nIt must be the school thing, my daughter just finished reading it, prompting me to give it another go, to fall back into Scout s world and pretend to be eight and let life simply be.\n\nHow is that? How can life for Scout be simple? I mean, she lives in the south, during the depression, she has to deal with ignorant schoolteachers and town folk, her ideas of what is right, what is what it should be are laughed at by her schoolmates  man, and I thought my childhood was rough.\n\nStill, she lives in this idyllic town, I mean, except for the racism and the creepy neighbors and the whole fact that it s, you know, the south (forgive me  I m not immune to the downfalls of the north, I mean, we had witches and well, Ted Bundy was born here ) But, there s this sense of childlike innocence to this book that makes me believe in humanity  even in the throes of evil. What am I saying here? I guess, that this is a good pick me up.\n\nWhat I also get from this book is that I have severe Daddy issues. I consume Atticus Finch in unnatural ways. He is the ultimate father; he has the perfect response for every situation. He is the transcendent character. My heart melts at each sentence devoted to him and I just about crumble during the courtroom scene.\n\nAm I gushing? I sure am. I was raised by a man who thought that Budweiser can artwork was the epitome of culture. That drinking a 6-pack was the breakfast of champions. That college was for sissies. He could throw out a racial slur without a single thought, care or worry to who was around. I won't even get into the debates/rantings of a 16 yr old me vs a 42 yr old him... What a role model.\n\nSo, I thank Harper Lee for giving me Atticus. I can cuddle up with my cider and pretend that I m basking in his light. I can write this blurb that makes sense to maybe a handful but that is okay, I am approved of and all is good.\nShow more",

            "content": "With endless books and infinitely more to be written in the future, it is rare occasion that I take the time to reread a novel. As women s history month is upon us (2019), I have kept revising my monthly lineup to feature books by remarkable women across the spectrum. Yet, none of these nonfiction books pay homage to the writers of the books themselves. Even with memoirs, the prose focuses on the author s achievements in her chosen field. Last week a goodreads friend and I paid tribute to women authors in a daily literary journal. In one of my friend s posts, she pointed out that as recently as 1960, the author of the most endearing of American novels had to use a masculinized version of her name in fear of not being published. Nelle Harper Lee of Monroeville, Alabama published To Kill a Mockingbird under her middle name, so only those well read readers are aware of the author s full name. It is in this regard, that I included Pulitzer and Presidential Medal of Freedom winner Nelle Harper Lee in my Women s History month lineup. It is as auspicious of a time as any to reread one of America s greatest novels.\n\nWhen I was in ninth grade English class, I read Harper Lee s novel for the first time. At age fourteen I was hardly a polished writer and struggled with many of the assignments. Yet, I do remember that the top essay in the class focused on the overarching theme of courage and how Harper Lee showed how each of the characters, major and minor, embodied this trait in the trying times associated with the novel. It was courageous of a southern woman to write a novel with this subject matter prior to the passage of the civil rights act. It is of little wonder to me looking back now that she chose to publish under a gender neutral name. Perhaps, she feared a lynch mob or being outcast in her home town. It was a trying time as the federal government asserted itself against states still grieving from the war between the states and holding out as the last bulwarks of white superiority. Harper Lee exhibited as much courage as the characters in her novel, and rightfully was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for her work. As such, being courageous starts from the top and works its way down to each and every character of this timeless work.\n\nIn 1930s rural Maycomb, Alabama people were pretty much set in their way of life. Town folk had received an education and worked as lawyers, doctors, bankers, and businessmen. The country folk may or may not have received an education because they had to work the fields and many were illiterate. Even the majority of those educated white folk still saw themselves as superior to blacks, and few, if any, had the audacity to take a black s word over a white s even if it were the correct moral thing to do. Yet, the crux of Lee s novel is a court case threatening to disrupt this way of life, having the town divide along both racial and moral lines, and having each character step into others  shoes and view the world from another s perspective. Maycomb at the time embodied many rural American cities, isolated from progress as town set in its ways with few people who were willing to see the world from another perspective. One man was, however, a lawyer named Atticus Finch who is among the most revered fictional characters ever created. Even though this court case should not have been his, his superiors selected Atticus to counsel a black defendant because they realized that he was the one man in Maycomb who had both the ability to empathize and the courage to do so. His neighbor Mrs Maudie Atkinson noted that Atticus was the same man in the court house as he was at home and had nothing to fear. A widower, he instilled these values to his children Jeremy Atticus (Jem) and Jean Louise (Scout) from a young age, passing a strong moral compass onto his children.\n\nIn addition to critiquing southern race relations, Lee s novel has endeared itself to children with the legend of Boo Radley. From the time they were young, Jem, Scout, and their summer friend Dill had courage to go to the Radley house trying to get Boo to come out even though all the other kids said the house was spooked. Atticus told them to put a halt to these childish games and explained Boo Radley s background to them. The town claimed that Boo Radley was a ghost, but perhaps the reason he did not leave the house is because he did not want to. As the children grew older, Atticus warned them that there would be darker times ahead and they would have to be courageous in the face of what people said to them behind their backs. From the time Scout began school in first grade, she inhibited Atticus  ability to stand up for what was right. Her teacher Miss Robinson was new to Maycomb and did not understand people s ways. Scout explained about the Cunninghams, the Ewells, as well as other families at a personal cost to herself. As Scout grew older and was able to step into other people s  shoes more, she grew to understand differences between folks; however, she and Jem realized that differences did not make the world distinctly black and white or right and wrong. During an era when children were looked upon as unintelligent, Scout and Jem were wise beyond their years and following in their father s footsteps.\n\nHarper Lee created strong archetypal characters and had each embody their own courage. Each s courage allowed Atticus to teach his children a life lesson that would endure for the rest of their lives. The family s neighbor Mrs. Henry Lafayette DuBose demonstrates courage as she battles a final illness. Third grade teacher Mrs. Gates exhibits courage as she teaches Scout s class about the rise of Nazism in Germany and th encourages her students to think for themselves about the differences between prejudices at home and abroad. The African American characters all demonstrate strong courage as well. The Finch s housekeeper Calpurnia is a bridge between the white and black communities of Maycomb and does not hesitate to teach Scout and Jem life lessons as they arise. The Reverend Sykes welcomes Jem and Scout into his congregation as though they were his own and invites them to sit in the colored balcony at time when segregation was still the law. He risked a lynching and knew that the Finch family could possibly be labeled as negro lovers, yet Reverend Sykes played a small role in proving that one s skin color should not determine whether someone is right or wrong. Of course, as part of the overarching story line, Boo Radley can be viewed as the most courageous character of them all. It is through the courage of an author to create characters who will stand up for what is morally right at a large cost to themselves that she created an award winning novel that was ahead of its time for its era. It is little wonder that the courage of these fictional characters has made the novel as beloved as it is today.\n\nI believe that the courage exhibited by all these characters has made the town of Maycomb, Alabama stand the test of time and remain the timeless classic that it is. Most people can relate to those who have the courage to stand up for what they think is right or to fight against those tougher than them. This character trait has endeared the Finch family to millions of readers and will continue to do so for generations to come. Whenever a person asks what book would you give as a gift or what is the perfect book, To Kill a Mockingbird is my first choice. I find that it is perfect for any time but most appropriate in spring as in addition to courage there is an underlying theme of hope. Harper Lee won the Pulitzer for this timeless classic, and it also won first place in the Great American Read as America s best novel. Thus I can think of no better way to honor women s history month than with a timeless book that has and will continue to capture the hearts and minds of all of its readers.\n\n5+ stars/ all-time favorites shelf\nShow more",

            "content": "In the course of 5 years, I ve read this book nearly 17 times. That adds up to reading it once at least every 4 months, on an average. And I still return to this book like a bark seeking a lighthouse in the dark. When I first finished it, I was so overwhelmed by how much I related to it, I read it nearly 8 times before the year ended. By now I ve memorized almost every scene and I still can t shake off the feeling that I still have to learn a lot from it. Over the years, I realize that without knowing it, it has become my personal Bible   a beacon to keep me from straying from the path of kindness and compassion, no matter what.\n\nWith its baseless cruelty and what Coleridge poetically referred to as , the world is in need of much   a rugged determination to keep the world a quiet haven and not the callous, cruel place it constantly aspires to be.\n\nis one of those rare books that doesn t give in to the belief that Not everybody is. And we must still persevere to see things from their perspective, and though we may not justify their ways, we must strive to understand them   though we might not follow them, we must try to be as kind to them as possible. And yet, there comes a time when some people need to be put down   we must follow the call of our conscience then, and yet be kind to them in the process, as much as we can.\n\nStriving to follow this dictum, I have realized how difficult it is to be kind to others when I find I m right. It is so easy to put down others bluntly, it is so easy to be critical and fair, but so difficult to consider for a moment what the other might be going through. How convenient it is to dismiss the hardships of others and say,  They had it coming!  and unburden our conscience of the probable guilt that perhaps we ve been a bit too harsh.\n\nHow simple it is to stereotype people, classify them neatly into convenient square boxes and systematically deal with them based on those black-or-white prejudices! Robe a prejudice in the opaque, oppressive garment called and display boldly the seal of and you ve solved the biggest difficulty of life   knowing how to treat people.\n\nAnd yet, nothing could be farther than the truth. Rarely are people so simple as they seem. In Wilde s words, For you never know when a grumpy, rude, racist Mrs. Dubose might be fighting her own monsters or Ewell be, in fact trying to protect the last vestiges of honor he has, or Aunt Alexandra only trying to advocate the least painful way of life. And though we might not agree with any of them, like Atticus, we must see them for their peculiar situations and grant them a little leeway, make a little corner for them too, and yet, stand up for what is right in defiance of them.\n\nIt is this tricky rope-walking balance between prejudice and common sense, kindness and firmness, and justice and leeway that spurs me to revisit this little book every time I seem to falter. While I find it difficult to keep my cool in the midst of flagrant injustices and ensuing pain, I strive to strike a balance between giving in to despair and becoming too optimistic; between becoming indifferent, unkind, righteous and being compassionate, considerate. It is what keeps me from becoming paranoid or cynical with the unceasing drone of passivity, callousness, overwhelming prejudice and unyielding customs while still being alive to the pain of those very people I do not necessarily agree with.\n\nIn a country like India with its bizarre, incomprehensible equations and sequestrations of religion, class, caste, region, language, race, gender, sexuality and education, it takes a whole load of effort not to blow up one s mind   people will kill each other over anything and everything. They ll hate each other, isolate each other and cook up stories amongst themselves and leave it floating in the air. It takes every ounce of my energy not to hate my land and its majority people viciously.\n\nBut you see, I ve got so much to learn to survive here   I have to stand up for myself when there will be hordes banging upon my door telling me to shut the hell up. And I ll have to muster all the courage I have to tell them to go f*** themselves if they think I musn t transcend the limits set for me. But I also have to learn not to hate them. Even if it sounds silly.\n\nI know for one, Lee   I don t care if you never wrote another work. I don t care if Capote helped you write it, as many say. I m glad somebody wrote this book, and somebody assigned this book as syllabus when I needed it the most. Five years ago, I hadn t even heard of it. I read it in a single sitting. And then I read it several times over, taking my time, pondering over every page. I still do so. It is my favorite book ever.\nShow more",

In 1973 Hosseini's family returned to Kabul, and Hosseini's youngest brother was born in July of that year.\nIn 1976, when Hosseini was 11 years old, Hosseini's father obtained a job in Paris, France, and moved the family there. They were unable to return to Afghanistan because of the Saur Revolution in which the PDPA communist party seized power through a bloody coup in April 1978. Instead, a year after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, in 1980 they sought political asylum in the United States and made their residence in San Jose, California.\nHosseini graduated from Independence High School in San Jose in 1984 and enrolled at Santa Clara University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in biology in 1988. The following year, he entered the University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine, where he earned his M.D. in 1993. He completed his residency in internal medicine at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles in 1996. He practiced medicine for over ten years, until a year and a half after the release of The Kite Runner.\nHosseini is currently a Goodwill Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). He has been working to provide humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan through the Khaled Hosseini Foundation. The concept for the foundation was inspired by the trip to Afghanistan that Hosseini made in 2007 with UNHCR.\nHe lives in Northern California with his wife, Roya, and their two children (Harris and Farah)."

            "content": "Finished this book about a month ago but it's taken me this long to write a review about it because I have such mixed feelings about it. It was a deeply affecting novel, but mostly not in a good way. I really wanted to like it, but the more I think about what I didn't like about the book, the more it bothers me. I even downgraded this review from two stars to one from the time I started writing it to the time I finished.\n\nLet's start off with the good, shall we? The writing itself was pretty good when it comes to description, in that I really felt the author's descriptions of scenes, and in terms of moving the story forward. That said, it's not particularly challenging writing to read.\n\nThe very best part of the novel is its warm depiction of the mixed culture of Afghanistan, and how it conveys the picture of a real Afghanistan as a living place, before the coup, the Soviet invasion, and above all, the Taliban and the aftermath of September 11th created a fossilized image in the US of a failed state, petrified in \"backwardness\" and locked in the role of a villain from central casting.\n\nNow for the not so good.\n\n== Spoiler Alert ==\n... because I don't think I'm going to be able to complain about what I didn't like about the book without revealing major plot points. (Not to mention, some of what follows will only make sense to someone who has read the book.) So if you don't want to spoil it for yourself, read no further, here be spoilers:\n\nMy overwhelming emotion throughout the book is feeling entirely manipulated. Of course, one major reason for this is that the author's attempts at metaphor, allegory, and forshadowing are utterly ham-fisted. When he wants to make a point, he hits you over the head with it, hard -- Amir's split lip / Hassan's cleft palate comes immediately, resoundingly to mind.\n\nBut I feel manipulated beyond that. The members of the servant class in this story suffer tragic, unspeakable calamities, sometimes at the hands of our fine hero, and yet the novel seems to expect the reader to reserve her sympathies for the \"wronged\" privileged child, beating his breast over the emotional pain of living with the wounds he has selfishly inflicted upon others. How, why, am I supposed to feel worse for him as he feels bad about what he has done to others? Rather than feeling most sympathy and kinship for those who, through absolutely no fault of their own, must suffer, not just once or twice, but again and again?\n\nOf course this elevation of / identification with the \"wounded\"/flawed hero goes hand in hand with an absolutely detestable portrayal of the members of the servant class as being at their utmost happiest when they are being their most servile and utterly subjugating their own needs, wants, desires, pleasures -- their own selves, in fact -- to the needs of their masters. (Even when they are protecting their masters from their own arrogance, heartlessness, or downright stupidity.)\n\nI don't see how the main character, Amir, could possibly be likeable. Amir's battle with Assef, momentous as it is, is not so much him taking a stand because he feels driven to do so or feels that he must. Rather, he acts with very little self-agency at all -- he is more or less merely carried forward into events. (And, moreover, in the end it is Sohrab (Hassan again) who saves him.)\n\nI finished the novel resenting Amir, and even more intensely resenting the author for trying to make the reader think she's supposed to care about Amir, more than about anyone else in the story.\n\nA couple other points: I'm wondering if one theme of the novel is that there are no definitive happy endings, no single immutable moments of epiphany or redemption. Because Amir's moral \"triumph\", such as it is, over Assef, is so short-lived. He manages to crash horrifically only a week or two later, when he goes back on his word to Sohrab about his promise not to send him to an orphanage.\n\nAnd lastly, I don't understand why Baba's hypocrisy is not more of a theme. He makes such a point of drilling into his son's head that a lie is a theft of one's right to the truth. His own hipocrisy there is a profound thing, and it's a shame the author doesn't do more with it.\n\nNevertheless, after all the bad things I had to say about it, I do have a couple quotes worth keeping:\n\n\"Every woman needed a husband. Even if he did silence the song in her.\" (p.178)\n\n\"'That's the real Afghanistan, Agha sahib. That's the Afghanistan I know. You? You've been a tourist here, you just didn't know it.'\" (p. 232)\n\n\n=== UPDATE ===\n\nThe Kite Runner\n\nThe Kite Runner.\n\n\n\n\nThere have been many comments to my review since I first wrote it, and I thought it might be about time for me to weigh in for a moment.\n\nBefore I get into my response, I must start off with a great thank you for all those who have felt sufficiently moved (positively or negatively) by my review to comment and respond. I appreciate all the comments, whether I agree with them or not.\n\nFirst of all, I'd like to address the question of whether we're \"supposed\" to like Amir or not. Yes, I do realize that sometimes writers create and/or focus on a character that the reader is not meant to like. Here, though, the story is clearly meant to be about some kind of redemption -- but I found Amir so distasteful, that I simply wasn't interested in his redemption. The focus of the story was entirely on how Amir's life had been corrupted by the despicable things he'd done - when the things he'd done were entirely part and parcel of the position of power and privilege he occupied over Hassan.\n\nWhich brings me to my second point, the insufferable current of paternalism that runs throughout the story. The members of the servant and poorer classes are consistently portrayed as saintly, absurdly self-sacrificing, one-dimensional characters. Regardless of what terrible things befall them, they are shown to have nothing but their masters' interests at heart. Granted, it may be unlikely that the powerless would be overtly talking back and setting their masters straight; however, the novel gives no indication that they even have any private wishes of recrimination, or much of a private life, for that matter. Given this portrayal, it is even more difficult for me to muster any interest in Amir's suffering. But to suggest that perhaps we're misinterpreting the servants' subservient attitudes because we approach the story from a different time, place, or culture, is simply to engage in a cultural relativism borne out of -- and perpetuating -- the very same paternalism.\n\nTo clarify my point, let's look at some comparable examples from US culture. Consider any one of a huge number of films such as , , , or (all simply continuing a tradition that reaches back to Shirley Temple's days) in which noble servants or similar helpers have absolutely no concern in their lives other than making sure the wealthy people they are serving have happy, fulfilled lives -- while they themselves never seem to have any of their own personal hopes, desires, triumphs, tragedies, or even any hint of a home, family, personal, or romantic life at all. Their total happiness is bound up entirely with serving the lives of their rich counterparts. It is this quality, present throughout Hosseini's book, that bothers me most.\n\nIn the end, however, a beautifully written story could have overcome these criticisms -- or at the very least, I would have been able to temper or counter my points above with lavish praise for the writing. However, here, again, the novel falls flat. It is not particularly well-written. As some other commenters have also pointed out, the storytelling is quite heavy-handed, and the narrative suffers from implausible plot twists and uncanny coincidences, and a writing style that relies far too heavily on cliches and obvious literary devices.\n\nI wish that I could say I liked the book more. To answer [another commenter's] question, I haven't read ; I'm afraid I wasn't particularly motivated to do so after my reaction to this one. However, I do believe, as that commenter also suggests, that there is something to be gained from the debate and discussion that the book has inspired.\nShow more",

            "content": "In 2012, when I was Mathematics teacher at a private high school in Iran, I had an Afghan student in my class. Sometimes, I discussed with my students about literature, and I told them of novels and poem. I found it very strange that my students had no interest in literature and even sometimes looked with hostility to this discussion. Days passed and much time was left to the end of school year. One day I saw Ali, Afghan student, came to me and had a booklet in his hand and I saw in his eyes several times as if he wanted to say something, but he was quiet. I waited for a little, and after a few moments, I began to speak. He smiled, and with a special Afghan accent, he said \" I have written a story, sir \" and became quiet again. I said \"it's excellent! \", and I asked, \"do you read books? \". Yes, sir, he replied. I asked, \"what kind of books do you like? \". Mark Twain and John Steinbeck and Jules Verne, he answered. I asked what you have written? He replied I wrote a story about a 13 years old Afghan boy who immigrated to Iran. I got his booklet, and I read it in a week. It was a dark story. A week later, we discussed again after class. Ali invited me to go his house at night for reading books. I was pleased, and I greeted this plan. When night arrived, I took the kite runner and went to Ali's home. When I entered the house, I saw a house with mud walls that has no rooms, except a small hull that there was a table in the middle of it and almost nine children were dining. Of clothes of Ali's father, it was obvious that he was a building worker and he welcomed me very sincerely. I thanked him, and I went to the storehouse in the corner of the yard that Ali had made it, a place to be alone. Ali took the book and with incredible passion began to read. This process was repeated almost every night for a week, and we have read half of the Kite Runner. Among pages of the book, Ali informed me about Afghanistan, explained of how twenty people, entered Iran with a small car, illegally and secretly. Of how his classmates ridiculed him because of his Afghan accent, of how he was forced to work in a brick burner factory all days after the school, of how his dad has forced him to marry at the age of 13 in the summer. Then Ali proceeded to speak that he wants to be a writer and prizes the Nobel award. I saw in his room that he had Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Hafiz and Rumi's book poem. When I looked at his face, I saw an unusual man who was ahead of his time and situation. Ali said, because Afghans have been banned of the registration in public schools in Tehran, he is forced to register in a private school, and now he and his mother must work hard to pay school charges.\nThe next week, I went to class, but I didn't see Ali. When I asked the guys about him, they replied that because his father hadn't citizenship card and passport, he was arrested, and all of them have deported to Afghanistan. I was agitated that I couldn't continue reading Kite Runner never. Even I felt so depressed and sad when I saw the book in bookstores. Until this spring, after three years, I got a message in WhatsApp messenger from Ali, that congratulated teachers day to me. He was written that he married to a girl who was in love with her and they have a two months old girl baby.

            "content": "This is the sort of book White America reads to feel worldly. Just like the spate of Native American pop fiction in the late eighties, this is overwhelmingly colonized literature, in that it pretends to reveal some aspect of the 'other' culture, but on closer inspection (aside from the occasional tidbit) it is a thoroughly western story, firmly ensconced in the western tradition.\n\nEven those tidbits Hosseini gives are of such a vague degree that to be impressed by them, one would have to have almost no knowledge of the history of Afghanistan, nor the cultural conflicts raging there between the Shia and Sunni Muslims, or how it formed a for Russia and the United States in the Cold War, or for in the centuries before. Sadly, for all the daily news reports about Afghanistan, most people know very little of its history.\n\nHosseini's story is thickly foreshadowed and wraps up so neatly in the end that the reader will never have to worry about being surprised. Every convenient coincidence that could happen, does happen. He does attempt to bring some excitement to the story with dramatized violence, but that's hardly a replacement for a well-constructed plot. He is also fond of forcing tension by creating a small conflict between two characters and then having them agonize over it for years, despite the fact that it would be easy to fix and the characters have no reason to maintain the conflict. And since the conflict does not grow or change over time, everything is quickly reduced to petty and repetitive reactions.\n\nHe even creates a cliched 'white devil' character, a literal sociopath (and pedophile) as the symbol for the 'evils' of the Taliban. This creates an odd conflict in the narrative, since one of the main themes is that simple inequalities and pointless conflicts stem from Afghan tradition, itself. His indelicate inclusion of wealthy, beautiful, white power as the source of religious turmoil in the mid-east negates his assertion that the conflicts are caused by small-mindedness.\n\nThe fact that this character seems to have the depth of motivation of a Disney villain also means that he does not work as a representation of the fundamental causes of colonial inequality, which tend to be economic, not personal. The various mixed messages about the contributors to the ongoing Afghan conflict suggest that Hosseini does not have anything insightful to say about it.\n\nPerhaps the worst part about this book is how much it caters to the ignorance of White America. It will allow naive readers to feel better about themselves for feeling sympathy with the larger mid-east conflict, but is also lets them retain a sense of superiority over the Muslims for their 'backwards, classicist, warlike' ways. In short, it supports the condescending, parental view that many Americans already have about the rest of the world. And it does all this without revealing any understanding of the vast and vital economic concerns which make the greater mid-east so vitally important to the future of the world.\n\nIt is unfortunate that nowhere amongst this book's artfully dramatized violence and alternative praising and demonizing of the West is there the underlying sense of why this conflict is happening, of what put it all into place, and of why it will continue to drag us all down. The point where it could turn sympathy into indignation or realization is simply absent.\n\nThere is a bad joke on the internet showing a map of the world with the mid-east replaced by a sea-filled crater with the comment 'problem solved'. What this map fails to represent is that there is a reason the West in the affairs of the mid-east, and that every time we do, it creates another conflict--because almost every group who we decry as terrorists now were originally trained and armed by the US and Western powers to serve our economic interests.\n\nAs long as we see extremists as faceless sociopaths, we can do nothing against them. We must recognize that , and that everyone sees himself as being 'in the right'. Who is more right: the Westerner whose careless bomb kills a child, or the Muslim's that does?\n\nThe point shouldn't be to separate the 'good Muslims' from the 'bad Muslims', because people aren't fundamentally good or bad. They are fundamentally people. Almost without exception, they are looking out for their future, their children, and their communities. Calling someone 'evil' merely means you have ceased to try understanding their point of view, and decided instead to merely hate because it's easier to remain ignorant than to try to understand.\n\nThis book isn't particularly insightful or well-written, but that is in no way unusual in bestsellers. The problem is that Americans are going to use this book to justify their ignorance about the problems in the east. This book will make people feel better about themselves, instead of helping them to think better about the world.\n\nFor an actually insightful, touching view of the Afghan conflict, I would suggest avoiding this bit of naive melodrama and looking up Emmanuel Guibert's .\nShow more",

It is going to manipulate your emotions. It may include some random words in my native language for no reason whatsoever. It will teach you unnecessary things about my culture. It will not be smarter than a fifth grader. And it will include as many cliches and as much foreshadowing as is humanly possible.\n\nYou are going to be shocked. I, for one, never saw it coming. So I doubt you will. Get ready. Aren't you so ready to be shocked? You're never going to see this coming.\n\nWhat comes next is the big revelation, so get ready!\n\nWait, I need to ask you something first. Did you know that the Irish like potatoes? Yeah, we really enjoy them. And alcohol too. It's pretty great. This means Ireland Forever! Unfortunately, you will be very sad to know that my father just died due to an Irish car bomb. Well, about 15 of them to be exact. All on an empty stomach! It makes me sad and you should feel sad too, kind reader.\n\nOk, on to the big reveal. Here it is:\n\nOn that frigid overcast day, which happened to be the day that I decided to quit reading , I became a book snob.\n\nBecause is adored by most people who read it, I am forced to conclude that most people need to read more. A whole lot more. You should be embarrassed if you like this book. Seriously. The moment I became a book snob (shortly after \"The Scene\"), I became so embarrassed to be seen reading it that I accused the guy sitting next to me on the subway of putting the book on my lap while I wasn't paying attention. \"How dare you, sir! Have you no decency?\" I exclaimed excitedly in my native language. Then I noticed a monkey on the platform waiting to board a train. I quickly hopped off my train, ran to him, handed him the book, and said \" Enjoy!\"\n\nLater that day, I saw that monkey flying a kite in front of the Washington Monument. I noticed that the glass string wasn't making his hands bloody. Do you know why? He was wearing gloves.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nPlease note that I have absolutely no appreciation for life and reality.*\n\n*, who claims to be \"a better person for having read this book,\" that I make this clarification to my review. Thanks for the suggestion, Bart! Hopefully that clears things up for those who were wondering.\nShow more",

It was also so real that I had to Google, \"Is The Kite Runner based on a true story?\" If you are wondering, no, it is not.\n\nHonestly, this book was so moving and beautiful that I was crying at multiple spots in the book. It would be hard to convey how much I love this book. Even typing this review, I am tearing up. Love in real life is not a Hallmark movie or a Lifetime show. Even people we love let us down and disappoint from time to time. The world doesn't always give us an easy hand in life.

            "content": "Sad stories make good books.\n\n\"I became what I am today at the age of twelve, on a frigid overcast day in the winter of 1975.\"\n\nThere are two types of books, usually, that makes one feel like there are no words to describe the experience: They are either unbelievably detrimental, or exceptionally (and positively) impactful. Given the overall high rating, it is redundant to tell, to which category does The Kite Runner belong. I don't think there are that many books, especially fiction, that could leave such a profound effect on a reader's mind.\n\n\n\n\nWhat I loved the most about this book is the set of characters. Hosseini has done an amazing job developing them, which increases the emotional impact of the plot tenfold. Especially, it's remarkable how well he handled the first person protagonist, Amir. The traditional 'do wrong, then atone, conclude with happy ending' is not the way with The Kite Runner, but utilizes an attempt to direct Amir towards a path of atonement, while sticking to a more realistic ending. Had it not been for Hosseini's unique narrative, Amir's character could have turned far more contemptible. Luckily, for me, it was never the case. Many would probably love the secondary characters more, but it is important to remember that it was the protagonist's undistorted, self-criticizing account of the events that made it that way. It's not a perspective you see everyday, but I loved it.\n\n\n\nI was perfectly satisfied with the pace of the story, including the intermittent jumps in time Hosseini used to separate the book in to a few main parts. Each of these parts had their own theme going on, while introducing an occasional twist to keep things interesting. The only minor complaint I have is about the attempt at creating a villain. Even though it introduced a tiny bit of mystery to the plot, that particular part felt a little out of harmony with the rest.\n\n\n\nThe writing style is somewhat simple, but I believe most readers would be too absorbed in the plot to notice it. If anything, it felt more appropriate, reducing distractions from the flow of the story. But the plot, and the characters make up perfectly for any other shortcoming in my opinion. I wouldn't call this an emotional rollercoaster, for, the majority of the emotions include regret, disappointment, sadness, fear, anger, privation but very little happy ones. But all this helped the book become more moving. I usually don't enjoy books with sad endings but this one was definitely an exception, and worth all the heartbreak.\n\n\n\nBefore starting the book, based on almost all the reviews, I knew this was a sad story. But with fiction, if and when things get too depressing, a reader could always be consoled by the fact that this is, after all, fiction. It's easier attributing everything to being not real, and proceed from that safe spot. You're no going to find that solace here. If anything, unless we are fooling ourselves, the severity of reality has been lessened to make it more bearable. But I guess that's the whole point. That's what makes this deliver a profound reading experience. It enables all readers to understand, to empathize, and be considerate towards others. Kite Runner easily made it to my All-time-favorites and I believe this should be read by everyone.\nShow more",

Published in 2003 by Riverhead Books.\n\nIt tells the story of Amir, a young boy from the Wazir Akbar Khan district of Kabul, whose closest friend is Hassan.\n\nThe story is set against a backdrop of tumultuous events, from the fall of Afghanistan's monarchy through the Soviet military intervention, the exodus of refugees to Pakistan and the United States, and the rise of the Taliban regime.\n\n                         :                                                                                                 \n\n     :                     :                                                                                   1383     422       9645881927                                                -     21 \n\n     :                   :                                           1384     456  \n\n     :                    :                                           1385     383        9789643284953 \n\n     :                   :                                        1386     368        9644482972 \n\n     :                   :                                          1387     393        9789646939694 \n\n     :                   :                                       1388     331        9789642569410 \n\n     :                   :                                                1389     508         9786005541557 \n\n     :                   :                                         1389     376        9786001710421 \n\n     :                   :                                            1392     338        9786007076026 \n\n     :                   :                                          1393     368        9786007364055 \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n\n               : (                                                         \n**\n                                                                                   \n**\n        :      .                                                                                                   -                                                                                                                                                                                             .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    .                                                 )                      \n\n                   19/05/1399               .        \nShow more",

Amir desperately wants his father s approval, but Baba is not quick to give it. He is a rich man, brimming with macho vibrancy, while his son is a different sort altogether. Amir is fast friends with Hassan, the son of his father s servant. They are as close as brothers. But, beset by bullies, an event occurs that changes Amir s life. There is much death and horror in this portrait of a tortured country. But there is also emotional richness, and a look into the inner life. By the end of the book there was not a dry eye in the house. It is recommended unreservedly. A wonderful tale, movingly told.\nShow more",

            "content": " When you kill a man, you steal a life. You steal his wife s right to a husband, rob his children of a father. When you tell a lie, you steal someone s right to the truth. When you cheat, you steal the right to fairness. There is no act more wretched than stealing. \n\nI m going to be honest with you. To read this book was a constant struggle, not because I didn t like the writing style, not because it was bad and not because it was boring. No, if anything was so hard to read because it was so exceptionally painful.\n\nThis book made me so sad! I felt helpless and angry and there were times I actually was more than just tempted to stop reading. Some of the chapters were just too hard to bear and the book touched me in a way I can t even describe. It did something with me  and I m still not sure whether this was good or bad.\n\nAll I know is that the injustice in this book made me furious and that I just have to think about it and already feel sick to my stomach again. There were so many serious topics in this book but I think what really got to me was the central theme of violence, injustice and abuse. To read  The Kite Runner  was so devastating and nerve-racking I actually couldn t read more than two chapters a day. It was so upsetting that I found it difficult to motivate myself to read it and even though this was such a painful read, I still wanted to know what would happen next.\n\nAmir s and Hassan s story was so horrible, appalling, powerful and beautiful at the same time. It left me completely broken and raw and I think my emotions are still all over the place. So if my review sounds a little incoherent and illogical you can blame it on the book hangover I'm currently suffering from. XD\n\n\n\n\n\nAmir and Hassan are best friends who grew up together and live in Kabul. They do almost everything together and one of their favourite hobbies is kite running. One day there is a local kite-fighting tournament Amir is determined to win and with the help of Hassan he is even able to achieve his goal. The victory of the tournament comes with a high price though and in the end their moment of happiness isn t only short lived but also comes to an abrupt end. What happens after the competition destroys their lifelong friendship and shakes the foundations of their trust, the course of their lives changing as they try to deal with the repercussions of a single day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPuh, what to say about him? I think I never disliked a protagonist as much as I disliked the narrator of this story. I just couldn t stand his younger self and I thought he wasn t just egoistic but also spoiled and more than just unethical. The way Amir treated Hassan made me sick and his betrayal towards his best friend hurt so much! I mean how could he let this happen? How could he stand aside without intervening? How could he even think that Hassan is  just a Hazara ?! I don t understand it and if I m entirely honest I really think that it was good he felt bad throughout the entire book! His past haunted him and in the end it actually made him a better person. A person that stood up to bad people and a person I was finally able to forgive. It was a long journey for Amir but he eventually did the right thing and when I read the finial sentences of this book I was even proud of him. XD\n\n\n\n\n\nI waited 331 pages for that to happen!!! XD\n\n\n\n\n\nGod bless his kind and innocent soul!!! This boy was an angel and I don t even know how he was able to forgive Amir. As it seems he managed to do it though and my deep respect and love for his character will never cease. I loved Hassan with all my heart and I think his only flaw was that he was just too good to live in this sick and violent world. He would have deserved so much more than life gave him and when I found out about Sohrab s ordeal I was more than just heartbroken. I know Hassan must have turned over in his grave and I felt so, so, so damn sorry for what happened to both of them.\n\n\n\n\n\nBaba definitely was a very flawed character but I still couldn t help but had to love him for it. There was so much good in him, yet he also had his bad sides. For a person that was described as seeing the world in black and white he actually was all different kinds of grey and in some way that made him extremely likeable and disagreeable at the same time. *lol* I think he was a very contradictory person and after finding out about his secret I was finally able to understand why. Still, I loved that despite everything he tried to be a righteous man and when it comes down to it he certainly had his heart in the right place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis boy my heart and I don t even know how I m supposed to pick up the pieces. He was just ten!! Damn it!! I don t understand how people can hurt children and I can t even  *argharghsdfjklmno* I hate what Assef did to him and I m so glad Sohrab got away from his clutches! Chapter 22 was so horrible to read  It made me sick to my stomach and I swear I was tempted to throw the book against a wall  Urgh  just to think about his hands on Sohrab  My heart aches so much for that little boy!!! He deserved a better childhood than that! Damn no!! He actually deserved a childhood to begin with!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd OMG that beautiful ending! That hopeful, amazing and beautiful ending! It killed me, it was the death of me, it was the final nail in my coffin!!! That sweet and gentle and shy boy!!!! XD I already get emotional just thinking about it! *blinking away tears*\n\n\nI hated the book! I loved the book!\n\nI hated the injustice, the pain Ali, Hassan and Sohrab had to go through, I hated the way the Taliban treated everyone they considered to be wrong and different, I hated to read about the destruction of Amir s hometown, I hated the violence, I hated the war, I hated to read about the many orphans, the hungry children on the street. I hated the way Amir acted when he was younger!!!\n\n\n\nBut I loved the details about Afghan culture, I admired the bravery of Hassan and Baba, my heart sang whenever they tried to be righteous and good. In a world that had gone to hell they still tried to be decent, they still tried everything possible to stand up for their people, to do the right thing. They still had values and they didn t just believe in them, they also acted according to them!!!\n\nSo yes, for me was a very powerful book. It pushed my boundaries and forced me to fight through it! It made me think about unpleasant things, it forced me to see the bad and ugly things our world is made of, but it also showed me the good in people and their kindness!\n\nIf you can live with a broken heart and are able to deal with the pain, this book his highly recommended. If you re one of the faint-hearted you better give it a wide berth.\n\nAs for me, I definitely will never re-read this book ever again! I m kind of proud that I accomplished to read it though!

            "content": "Two little friends, an unspeakable secret, and a quest for redemption.\n\n\"Amir\" and \"Hassan\" are two little boys living in the peaceful Afghanistan of 1975, before the russian invasion, and the subsequent civil wars. Amir is the spoiled son of a wealthy and prominent merchant. Hassan is the cleft lipped son of an inferior caste, and a servant in the house they both live in. During their childhood they become fervent competitors in kite fighting tournaments, and unquestionable friends. Until one fateful day a traumatic event starts gradually separating them forever apart. Decades later, the dark secret that separated them so many years ago starts re-emerging. A secret that ends revealing long forgotten family betrayals, wars, and ethnic differences that led two little inseparable boys into very different life paths.\n\nA novel about the inherent strengths and weaknesses in each person, the guilts, and the terrible consequences of trying to endure them, or avoid them.\n\nHighly recommendable, very powerful, inexplicably painful. There are books that tell an unique unforgettable story, but there are a few special ones that also have the exceptional quality of transmitting something immensely valuable about the culture of a foreign country; beyond the deeply ideological differences, pros and cons you may find with such society. And, like I hold \"Shantaram\" as an unequalled novel about indian culture, I will hold \"Kite Runner\" as an inestimable novel about afghan. And I remain hopeful of ever finding books like these two, regarding any foreign culture.\n\nFew times I suffered so much with a book, but the level of suffering is a good measure of how much you strongly and deeply connected with said book. An infinity of quotes and moments to remember.\n\nStill remaining, the movie.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n:\n[2003] [371p] [Historical] [Highly Recommendable]\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nAmir y Hassan son dos peque os ni os viviendo en la pac fica Afganist n de 1975, antes de la invasi n rusa y las subsiguientes guerras internas.

The viciousness, unfairness, the tragedies shake you to the core, hurting you deeply as if tiny pieces of glasses are embedded under your skin.\n\nI think not any human being in this world can finish this book dry eyed.

            "content": "i really wanted to like this novel. judging from its thousands of 'five-star reviews' hailing it as the one of the 'best books ever written,' i'm in the minority when i state that this novel, while well-intentioned, just left a little bit of sour taste in my mouth.\n\nmy problems with the novel are as follows: first of all the writing itself is so ham-fistened, heavy-handed, distracting and otherwise puzzling that by the midway point, i seriously considered chucking the book against the wall. each page of the novel has at least 5-10 incomplete sentences. i'm all for experimental and fractered prose--but it's important for authors to use it judiciously. hosseini, unfortunately, beats it to death. a lot of his language is cliched, too, which is funny considering there's a passage in the book about a writing teacher who warns the narrator, amir, about using cliches. i don't know if that was supposed to be funny or not, but it made me laugh (and what was worse was the san francisco's chronicle's glowing review on the book's cover and the san francisco chronicle's glowing review of amir's novel--coincidence?).\n\nthe author's use of farsi--especially in the dialogue--was equally distracting. my point is that no one speaks the way his characters speak. people don't switch back and forth between languages while speaking, and if they do, they certainly don't speak 1/2 the sentence in english, say one word in farsi, then traslate the farsi word to english, then finish the sentence in english, when they're presumably speaking farsi to begin with. i didn't pick up this book for a crash course in colloquial farsi. after 370 pages, i was frustrated--and annoyed.\n\nhosseini's plot often borders on the ridiculous. the'twists' are just TOO coincidental--and not surprising at all (except in how contrived they are). for example, in a devasted kabul, amir sees a homeless man in the street. the homeless man, of course, was a former university professor who just happened to teach with amir's long deceased mother. what a coincidence! what makes it worse, is that the narrator, amir then explains that while that may, in fact, seem like a coincidence, it happens in afghanistan happens all the time. of course it does. in another example, amir's former nemesis, assaf (now a taliban crony), beats up amir and amir ends up with a scar above his lip, just like his dear friend hassan, who was born with cleft-pallet. oh, the coincidence! (and the fact that amir even runs into assef again is ridiculous). another example: amir and his wife aren't able to have children, and of course they find an orphan boy who happens to be extended family and they adopt him. what a coincidence! and after amir returns to afghanistan he doesn't call home to his dutiful wife for over a month. i kept wondering 'when's he gonna call home?' and any plot advanced by a series of 'tragedies,' (and in this book they are legion) shows little more than the writer's inability to craft a meaningful and interesting plot. not only is it pretty poor form, it's also highly manipulative and condescending. i found myself continually frustrated by hosseini's apparent distrust of the reader. we don't have to be told how and when to interpret metaphors. and if i read one more book where the protagonist is a writer or professor, i'm gonna ram my head into a metal post.\n\ni don't want to sound like a misanthrope or jaded literature reader because i'm certainly not. this novel just left me wanting so much more in terms of plot and characterization. having said that, however, the novel could be important in that shows the cruelty of the taliban. much of what hosseini writes about is important, especially for us westerners unfamiliar with the breadth and scope of the afghani tragedy.\n\nin the end, it was worth the $2.00 i paid for it.\nShow more",

            "content": "Abuse, caste system, and invasion long time effects\n\nDescribed in explicit detail\nThat s one of the reasons the book first had problems with all audiences, Westerners, and different fractions of the Afghan people. It s just totally in your face and doesn t care about genre conventions regarding violence and especially sexual explicitness. The fact that that s unacceptable in non democratic Afghan parties is understandable. But that first world people had problems with some heavy stuff is one more ridiculous overkill, especially because it uses the described atrocities to\n\nDenounce invasions, hierarchies, and sexual abuse\nThe cruelty of war is the most obvious problem everyone agrees upon, but what about status? No matter if it s in a feudal medieval state, a caste system, or defined by socioeconomic power and thereby worth, dividing people by giving them different social positions is a game as old as time. And it works so well, everyone high in the ranks will use her/his big influence to concrete this power for eternity and all others are busy fighting to reach the top or just somehow survive. Thereby, they aren t able to work together and realize the immense influence they could have as united citizens of a country or people of the world, and instead\n\nHelp the 1 percent become even mightier\nThe Western US and EU model of doing as if there is a democracy and equality, while it s in reality just an oligarchy of international megacorporations, military industrial complexes, and public private partnerships controlling all governments except for the rare eco social Nordic model ones, is even more ludicrous than pure caste systems. At least they honestly say that they believe in the hereditary, faith fueled, or traditional different worth of people. One of the most disturbing real life manifestations of this is how they deal with\n\nStrong sexual predators\nEveryone else is prey and they exactly know that nothing can happen to them. In industrialized countries, there is at least a small chance of a metoo wave and many speaking up after one dared to do so, although victim blaming, slut shaming, and perpetrator protection are often louder than the cries of the rape victims. In caste systems, it s simply a kind of inherent right of alphas to do whatever their fetish is with everyone else in alphabetic order. All these elements are united\n\nTo describe the unnatural friendship\nOf a high and a low ranking kid of a society. Besides great characterizations, the invasion pimping the plot, a detailed description of the Afghan society, and the mentioned deeper messages, innuendos, and connotations, their life is the essence of this outstanding novel. And there is no room for unrealistic fairytale tropes, happy endings, or justice in a country so grim, gruesome, and sadistic. The essence of the world humans love to create so much with\n\nSuperpowers playing chess with weaker nations\nNo matter which country in the Southern hemisphere, Middle East, and Central Asia, they are all victims of neocolonialism, sometimes full scale military invasions and occupations, and everything the WTO, World Bank, and IMF throw at them in economic warfare experiments. But guess what, hypocritical and bigoted Europeans and US Americans prefer to be sad about the terrible things described in novels showing the consequences of exploitation, than to realize that their political and economic system is the reason for all the suffering.\n\nTropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique:\nShow more",

            "content": "I liked this book a lot. Due to the uncomfortable nature of the story told, I'll probably never read it again, but I'm glad that I did read it once. I saw it as the story of one not very likeable boy growing up in a soon to be war torn region and his eventual struggle for redemption.\n\nI was quite surprised to see how popular some of the negative reviews of this book were and I'd like to comment on a few of the comments they contained.\n\nOne condemnatory critic said \"This is the sort of book White America reads to feel worldly.\" Ah, if only that were truer. In a study done not long ago, over half of American adult men, when asked, admitted to having read NO books in the last year. Personally, as a white American, this book made me grateful that I grew up where I did, and once again reminded me of how good I've had it, and how little I really know about life outside these insular, isolationist, United States.\n\nAnother critic claimed that this book \"...portrays Afghanistan as backward\" Personally I thought that it portrayed it as a war torn, deeply wounded country that was at one time a bit like our ante-bellum south. It was made quite clear that we saw pre-soviet Afghanistan through the eyes of a doubly privileged class, the rich child.\n\nAnother critic claimed \"The members of the servant and poorer classes are consistently portrayed as saintly, absurdly self-sacrificing, one-dimensional characters.\" Yes, that's true. But the viewpoint is a that of an over-privileged, rich, selfish child. Given the ante-bellum south atmosphere that our protagonist sees, it's a wonder that the epithet \"uncle Tom\" wasn't used.\n\nFinally one critic complained \"The book fails exactly where it most needs to succeed - in the depiction of the Taliban.\" Personally, I felt that while that need may be great, I didn't see that as the purpose of this book.\n\nI saw this book as the story of one man's journey toward redemption against a background of a troubled heritage. I sometimes recall doing things as a child that now makes me wonder about myself, and while I like to think I've become a better human being, I sometimes shudder at the savage, thoughtless child that was once under this skin. For the personal perspective alone, I think this book is a worthwhile, if sometimes uncomfortable, read. If you let it, it may make you a better person.\nShow more",

            "content": "The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini ( Berliani M. Nugrahani, Translator) is a 2004 Riverhead Books publication.\n\nEarlier this year I read Moloka'i by Alan Brennert, another book, like this one, written back in 2004. It seemed I was the only person in the world who had not read the book, and once I d finished reading it, I wondered why it had taken me so long to read it. This got me to thinking about all the books that I d intended to read, but never got around to. So, despite my strong feelings about making reading resolutions, I vowed to read more books  the entire world has read but me . Other than Moloka I, I have also read  The Handmaid s Tale , and now-  The Kite Runner .\n\nThe Kite Runner has over 68,000 reviews on Goodreads, so I m not going to recap the synopsis, nor am I going to break down all the various ways in which this book touched me in one way or another, or analyze all the important messages in the story, as I don t think I can add anything more to what has already been said.\n\nHowever, I couldn t simply leave a rating and felt compelled to add a few personal remarks about my experience with this novel- but I ll keep it brief.\n\nFirst of all- why on earth did I wait so long to read this book?\n\nThis story is an incredible gut-punching- heart-wrenching, powerful and very thought-provoking family saga.\n\nThe juxtaposition between the two boys and the separate paths on which they embark is tragic, but eventually leads to long overdue penance and justice, as well as redemption and forgiveness. This riveting drama is very reflective, and handled with crisp precision, evoking a myriad of emotions. While the story is deeply depressing and so very sad, it is also an uplifting, inspirational story of a personal reckoning and redemption, which is the part of the story I ll always carry with me.\n\nI m so very glad I took the time to finally sit down and read this book! Although the book is fifteen years old now, it still has the same profound resonance it did when first published. I m still hugging my box of tissues!\n\nAmazing storytelling, amazing book- One I will never forget!\nShow more",

            "content": "Check out more of my reviews at www.bookaddicthaven.com\n\n'The Kite Runner' had been sitting on my TBR list for years. I kept putting it off because while I was sure that it would be a fantastic book, it isn't the type of smutty romance that I usually read. I knew that I'd have to be in the right kind of mood to read it. Finally, I found myself wanting to read something a little different to break me out of a reading rut and I downloaded the Audible version of 'The Kite Runner' and started listening.\n\nAs expected, this book was nothing like my usual love stories. This book is the type of book that makes you think about your life and reevaluate your values and what you think you know. It is the type of book that makes you question what you'd do in a given situation if the tables were turned.\n\nIf you're like me, and have always been blessed to live in a country where you've never experienced the brutality and terror of warfare firsthand, this book serves as a reminder of how lucky you truly are. As a woman, and a mother of two daughters, I cannot begin to express how grateful I am that I was born in a country where women are treated as equals. Sure, there are still some inequalities. However, when I think of how women are treated in many other regions of the world, I am incredibly thankful to have the freedoms that I do.\n\nI won't rehash this story, because it's been done a million times already and I don't think there's anything I could say that hasn't been said already. However, I will say that this was a wonderful book. It was grim, brutal and depressing, but also beautiful at times. It was emotional and infuriating, but you can't say that you didn't \"feel\" while reading this one. I experienced a full range of emotions.\n\nIn the end, it grounded me and put all of my petty gripes into perspective. We all need to be reminded of how blessed we are at times. I highly recommend this book to anyone that is looking for an emotional and enlightening story.\nShow more",

            "content": "I found this book a failure of courage and imagination -- all the more upsetting for the author's astute sense of detail and wonderful psychological depth. But ask yourself this: if the Taliban are real humans than why are they not represented as such? No doubt we will all love the movie as well.\n\nIf you want to read a book on Afghanistan, I recommend Jason Elliot's An Unexpected Light.\n\nBelow is my complete review:\n\nI started out loving this book. Hosseini is dead on target in his depiction of children's psychology, the non-contractual relationships between master and servant, and in his weaving of the threads between trauma, memory, and denial.\n\nFurther, Hosseini captures the feel of life in a Third World country. His depiction of Afghanistan confirms my own short travels in Afghanistan during the 1970s. Indeed, I was becoming ever more excited with the possibility of teaching this book in my new course on Afghanistan. But alas.\n\nThe book fails exactly where it most needs to succeed - in the depiction of the Taliban. When we do not have an archive, or the possibility of getting at the facts and narratives of a part of history, fiction can be used creatively and responsibly in order to construct something real. Take, for example, the extraordinary slave narrative written by Guy Endore -- . After years of research, Endore writes a history of a slave engaged in rebellion just prior to the Haitian Revolution.\n\nHosseini has the skills but not the courage nor the empathy/sympathy to portray the Taliban as historical, sociological, economic, modern creations. Discounting and trivializing his own skills, he characterizes the Taliban in the easiest way -- as simple, cartoonish, evil. He thereby does nothing to enlighten us. Worse, he panders to a sleepwalking liberal public who happily accept his vision as a seemingly authentic reflection of their own myopia.\n\nMost everyone is satisfied: the U.S. public for having read about a country they destroyed -- feeling all the better at having disposed of evil; the publishers for their timely profit; and Hosseini for having expressed his romantic sense of loss.\n\nAt least V.S. Niapaul is honest about his hatred for his own people. Hosseini's twist is less forgivable -- he gives aide to the very people whose malice, neglect, ignorance, and misunderstanding of Afghan people is one key factor in the destruction of this beautiful land and vital people.\n\nA failure of imagination is often the result of a failure in will, in courage, in politics. Hosseini traps himself in the politics of nostalgia.\n\n(For a similar review with a more academic bent, please see:\n\n\nShow more",

Maybe I was more interested in the subject of women's rights in Afghanistan and it made my sympathies with the main characters. I was moved by the women's struggle whereas the story of Amir failed to impress me.\n\nI have to be honest. I despised Amir from the first page and my feelings did not changed throughout the book. I know it should not be a reason for not appreciating a book and I agree with that when I read a literature masterpiece such as Hunger, The Trial or Crime and Punishment. However, here is not the case. In Khaled Hosseini books, if you are not touched by the characters, the magic of the book is gone as he manipulates you into feeling in a certain way and cry your eyes out at the end. It worked with A thousand Splendid Suns. No so much here. Maybe the timing was wrong.\n\nEven if I hated the MC I still enjoyed Khaled Hosseini writing style.\nShow more",

            "content": " There are a lot of children in Afghanistan, but little childhood. \n\nI ve read books before with an unreliable narrator and also read accounts of cowardice and shame. Amir, the first-person protagonist and narrator from Hosseini s 2003 novel, filled me with such disgust and loathing that I almost put the book down at 25%.\n\nMy doctor would say that Amir suffered from AWDD   Ass whooping deficiency disorder and I would enthusiastically second that diagnosis.\n\nThat said, I invite everyone to read the book and see how it all plays out.\n\n There is a way to be good again... \n\nThe poet Galway Kinnell once wrote that there are some regrets we can never be rid of. He was right in so many ways. An inability to forgive ourselves for past moments of cowardice, shame and inaction are the most troubling and relentless sorrows we can face as humans wandering around on this poor earth. We can forgive others, even those who have harmed us greatly, but looking ourselves in the eye and offering absolution can be an act beyond so many of us.\n\nI took my time getting to this book for a great many reasons and now that I have finally read it, I am so glad. This book moved me. Hosseini was able to pluck heart strings of emotion that I had thought silent and stolid. The themes of loyalty, friendship, devotion countered with betrayal, animosity and selfishness were plaintive notes played out in a literary orchestra of human sentiment.\n\n I wondered if that was how forgiveness budded; not with the fanfare of epiphany, but with pain gathering its things, packing up, and slipping away unannounced in the middle of the night. \n\nWe follow a distorted tale of mistakes and timidity towards an ultimate chance at redemption. Amir s is an understood but still contemptuous plight of lost opportunity. Shielded by cultural, social and religious privilege, his regrettable acts of pusillanimity are displayed against the heroic and admirable examples of his steadfast friend Hassan and his intrepid father. Hosseini paints us a picture of an evolving and destabilizing Afghanistan, tortured for years with Soviet occupation and then granted only the briefest of reprieves before falling to the theocratic and brutal rule of the Taliban. Amir s journey is one of deliverance and redemption.\n\nHosseini s skill and adept description of a modern day caste system where an invisible division existed between the favored Pashtun and the disadvantaged Hazara may be a tale of Afghanistan, but this abstract and superficial distinction can also be a universal cautionary story about racism, intolerance and bigotry.\n\nBeautifully written and told with compassion, empathy and with a skilled writer s eye for detail and expression, this can also be a painful book to read. Not for everyone, but for those who can endure what is at times heartbreaking the reward is as magnificent as is this work.\n\n For you, a thousand times over  \n\nShow more",

            "content": "Guilt\nThe Kite Runner is emotional and immersive, a story that is amplified with its spotlight on society and culture within Afganistan - both past and present. The story relates to the lives of two boys, Amir and Hassan, growing up in Kabul and narrated through the eyes of Amir. There are major societal and lifestyle differences between them but it is the character and principles of the two boys that defines this literary classic. Amir is the son of a rich man, he is educated, refined, and most importantly for social standing, part of the Sunni ruling class. Hassan is the son of the household servant and is illiterate, physically robust, but unfortunately for him, part of the Shia lower class. At a young age, the two boys probably saw each other as play friends, rather than the additional baggage or benefits their class positions bestow on them. However, as children grow up they inherently know where power resides and it doesn't take long for Amir to recognise his family's dominance and Hassan's family servitude.\n\nFollowing an incident where Hassan suffers physically and psychologically in protecting Amir, it leaves Amir with an unshakeable sense of guilt and culpability that manifests itself in a resentful disposition towards Hassan. Hassan suffers twice for being a better friend. The class system plays its part but the cowardice of Amir clings to his memories and will haunt him throughout his life. The writing flows wonderfully and the story is so imperceptibly built to capture emotions and our sentiments of injustice.\n\nYears after Amir immigrated to the United States he returns with the hope of righting some of these wrongs and seeking redemption with Hassan. Since Amir was last in Afghanistan the Taliban are now in control of the state - including government and religion. The country Amir knew now feels alien as he experiences the emotional horrors and fear of life under the Taliban. They are also dangerous times where the outward display of appearance and loyalty are crucial not to fall foul of the authorities.\n\nThis is a really superb book on so many levels   the history, location, religion, social culture, character interaction and it s ultimately dealing with human emotions of friendship and guilt. I would highly recommend reading this book. In fact, it's a must-read!\nShow more",

I try to stay away from controversial topics because I don't want to waste my energy on controversies and arguments. So, I will be leaving out parts which I do not want to mention here even though they're important in this context.)\n\nI look for the writing, the characters and the basic plot and how these three factors develop in the book.\n\nI love this book as it's a strong character driven story told from the perspective of Amir.\n\nThere's a strong portrayal of discrimination of caste and certain groups of people in the community.\n\nHassan belonged to such a community. He grew up with Amir; his father Ali grew up with Amir's father. But Ali and Hassan are 'hazaras' and were regarded as servants.\n\nAmir's father is one of the best character portrayal in books so far. This character had the strongest presence in the book. He's so real.\n\nAn event changed everything where Amir could have done something but he didn't (he was just a kid for god's sakes!) and for someone who lacked confidence and approval from his father for whatever he did, he's the character who O sympathise with. For the rest of his life, he lived in pain and guilt.\n\nHassan. (Sorry. I can't write about him without crying and wailing... So I can't write about him today.)\n\nSohrab. My baby boy. Hassan's son.\n\nI hope Amir and Soraya give him all the love he needs.\n\n\nI don't want to give away the plot. But yes, the writing is really good. The emotions raw and gnawing. The story ended well and good.\n\nTrigger warnings for rape, paedophilia, violence, strong language, suicidal tendency and self-harm.\nShow more",

    "description": "The new novel by George Orwell is the major work towards which all his previous writing has pointed. Critics have hailed it as his \"most solid, most brilliant\" work. Though the story of Nineteen Eighty-Four takes place thirty-five years hence, it is in every sense timely. The scene is London, where there has been no new housing since 1950 and where the city-wide slums are called Victory Mansions. Science has abandoned Man for the State. As every citizen knows only too well, war is peace.\n\nTo Winston Smith, a young man who works in the Ministry of Truth (Minitru for short), come two people who transform this life completely. One is Julia, whom he meets after she hands him a slip reading, \"I love you.\" The other is O'Brien, who tells him, \"We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness.\" The way in which Winston is betrayed by the one and, against his own desires and instincts, ultimately betrays the other, makes a story of mounting drama and suspense.\n\nAlternate cover edition can be found .",

        "bio": "Eric Arthur Blair, better known by his pen name George Orwell, was an English author and journalist. His work is marked by keen intelligence and wit, a profound awareness of social injustice, an intense opposition to totalitarianism, a passion for clarity in language, and a belief in democratic socialism.\n\nIn addition to his literary career Orwell served as a police officer with the Indian Imperial Police in Burma from 1922-1927 and fought with the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War from 1936-1937. Orwell was severely wounded when he was shot through his throat. Later the organization that he had joined when he joined the Republican cause, The Workers Party of Marxist Unification (POUM), was painted by the pro-Soviet Communists as a Trotskyist organization (Trotsky was Joseph Stalin's enemy) and disbanded. Orwell and his wife were accused of \"rabid Trotskyism\" and tried in absentia in Barcelona, along with other leaders of the POUM, in 1938. However by then they had escaped from Spain and returned to England.\n\nBetween 1941 and 1943, Orwell worked on propaganda for the BBC. In 1943, he became literary editor of the Tribune, a weekly left-wing magazine. He was a prolific polemical journalist, article writer, literary critic, reviewer, poet, and writer of fiction, and, considered perhaps the twentieth century's best chronicler of English culture.\n\nOrwell is best known for the dystopian novel (published in 1949) and the satirical novella (1945)   they have together sold more copies than any two books by any other twentieth-century author. His 1938 book , an account of his experiences as a volunteer on the Republican side during the Spanish Civil War, together with numerous essays on politics, literature, language, and culture, have been widely acclaimed.\n\nOrwell's influence on contemporary culture, popular and political, continues decades after his death. Several of his neologisms, along with the term \"Orwellian\"   now a byword for any oppressive or manipulative social phenomenon opposed to a free society   have entered the vernacular."

            "content": "YOU. ARE. THE. DEAD. Oh my God. I got the chills so many times toward the end of this book. It completely blew my mind. It managed to surpass my high expectations AND be nothing at all like I expected. Or in Newspeak \"Double Plus Good.\"\n\nLet me preface this with an apology. If I sound stunningly inarticulate at times in this review, I can't help it. My mind is completely fried.\n\n, with its richly developed culture and economics, not to mention a fully developed language called Newspeak, or rather more of the anti-language, whose purpose is to limit speech and understanding instead of to enhance and expand it. The world-building is so fully fleshed out and spine-tinglingly terrifying that it's almost as if George travelled to such a place, escaped from it, and then just wrote it all down.\n\nI read Fahrenheit 451 over ten years ago in my early teens. At the time, I remember really wanting to read 1984, although I never managed to get my hands on it. I'm almost glad I didn't. Though I would not have admitted it at the time, it would have gone over my head. Or at the very least, I wouldn't have been able to appreciate it fully.\n\nFrom the start, the author manages to articulate so many of the things I have thought about but have never been able to find a way to put into words. Even in the first few chapters I found myself having to stop just to quietly consider the words of Mr Orwell.\n\nFor instance, he talks about how . It is communicating with the future. I write these words now, but others may not discover them for hours, weeks, or even years. For me, it is one time. For you the reader, it is an entirely different one.\n\nJust the thought that reading and writing could one day be outlawed just shivers my timbers. I related to Winston so much in that way. I would have found a way to read or write.\n\n. The society in the book has no written laws, but many acts are punishable by death. The slogan of the Party (War is Peace...) is entirely convoluted. Individuality is frowned upon and could lead to being labeled a traitor to the Party.\n\nI also remember always wondering why the title was 1984. I was familiar with the concept of Big Brother and wondered why that wasn't the name of the book. In the story, they don't actually know what year it is because so much of the past has been erased by the Ministry of Truth. It could very easily have been 1981. I think that makes the title more powerful. Something as simple as the year or date is unknown to these people. They have to believe it is whatever day that they are told it is. They don't have the right to keep track. Knowledge is powerful. Knowledge is necessary. But according to Big Brother. Ignorance is strength.\n\n1984 is written in past tense and has long paragraphs of exposition, recounting events, and explaining the society. These are usually things that distance me from a book and from the characters, but Orwell managed to keep me fully enthralled. He frequently talks in circles and ideas are often repeated but it is still intriguing, none the less. I must admit that I zoned out a bit while Winston was reading from The Book, but I was very fascinated by the culture.\n\nSometimes it seems as though the only way to really experience a characters emotions is through first person. This is not the case with this book, as it is written in third person; yet, I never failed to be encompassed in Winston's feelings. George manages to ensure that the reader never feels disconnected from the events that are unfolding around them, with the exception of the beginning when Winston is just starting to become awakened. I developed a strong attachment to Winston and thrived on living inside his mind. I became a member of the Thought Police, hearing everything, feeling everything and last but not least, (what the Thought Police are not allowed to do) questioning everything.\n\nI wasn't expecting a love story in this book, but the relationship between Julia and Winston was truly profound. I enjoyed it even more than I would have expected and thought the moments between them were beautiful. I wasn't sure whether he was going to eventually betray Julia to the Party or not, but I certainly teared up often when it came to their relationship.\n\nGeorge has an uncanny ability to get to the base of the human psyche, at times suggesting that we need to be at war for many different reasons, whether it's at war with ourselves or with others. That is one thing I have never understood: why humans feel the need to destroy and control each other.\n\nIt seems that the main and recurring message in this book is about censorship and brainwashing. One, censorship, is limited and little exposure to ideas of the world; the other, brainwashing, is forced and too much exposure to a certain ideas. Both can be extremely dangerous.\n\nInside the ministry of Truth, he demonstrates the dangers of censorship by showing how the Party has completely rewritten the past by forging and abolishing documents and physical evidence. We also spend quite a bit of time with Winston in the Ministry of Love, where the brainwashing takes place. Those who commit thoughtcrime are tortured until they grow to love and obey Big Brother and serve only the interests of the Party.\n\nA common theme occurred to me throughout the book, although it wasn't necessarily referenced consistently. The good of the many is more important than the good of the one. There are so many variables when it comes to this statement and for the most part it seems natural to say, \"Of course, the many is more important than the one\", but when inside Winston's head, all that I began to care about was his well-being and not if he was able to help disband or conquer the Party and Big Brother. I just wanted him to be at peace.\n\nWhether or not the good of all is more important than that of the one, I can't answer. I think most people feel their own happiness is more important than the rest of the world's, and maybe that's part of the problem but it's also human nature. I only wish we could all accept one other regardless of belief and culture and not try to force ways of life onto other people. Maybe I'm naive for thinking that way, but so be it.\n\nI almost don't know what to think about this book. I'm not even sure my brain still works, or if it ever worked right at all. This book has a way of making you think you know exactly what you believe about everything and then turning you completely upside down and making you question whether or not you believe anything at all about anything. It's the strangest thing. Hmmm. Doublethink? Perhaps. Perhaps not.\n\nEverything about this book is captivating. It's groundbreaking yet at the same time, purely classic. Ahead of its time, yet timeless. From Big Brother to the Thought Police, I was hooked and wanted to know more about it all.\n\nBasically, I think everyone should read 1984 at some point. You really have to be in the mood to work at reading it, though. But it's all worth it in the end. It's absolutely incredible and I loved it. I don't re-read many books but this will definitely be one of them. It is a hard read, but more importantly, it is a MUST read.\nShow more",

            "content": "This book is far from perfect. Its characters lack depth, its rhetoric is sometimes didactic, its plot (well, half of it anyway) was lifted from Zumyatin s We, and the lengthy Goldstein treatise shoved into the middle is a flaw which alters the structure of the novel like a scar disfigures a face.\n\nBut in the long run, all that does not matter, because George Orwell got it right.\n\nOrwell, a socialist who fought against Franco, watched appalled as the great Soviet experiment was reduced to a totalitarian state, a repressive force equal in evil to Fascist Italy or Nazi Germany. He came to realize that ideology in an authoritarian state is nothing but a distraction, a shiny thing made for the public to stare at. He came to realize that the point of control was more control, the point of torture was more torture, that the point of all their \"alternative facts\" was to fashion a world where people would no longer possess even a word for truth.\n\n\n\nOrwell s vision of the world is grim; too grim, some would argue, for it may deprive the faint-hearted among us of hope. But Orwell never wanted to take away hope. No, he wished to shock our hearts into resistance by showing us the authoritarian nightmare achieved: a monument of stasis, a tribute to surveillance and control.\n\nHere, in the USA, in 2017, our would-be totalitarians are a long way from stasis. Right now they re stirring up chaos and confusion, spreading lies and then denying they spread them, hoping to gaslight us into a muddle of helplessness and inactivity. They are trying to destroy a vigorous democracy, and they know it will take much chaos and confusion to bring that democracy down. They hate us most when we march together, when we occupy senate offices and jam the congressional switchboard, when we congregate in pubs and coffee houses and share our outrage and fear, for they know that freedom thrives on solidarity and resistance, and that solidarity and resistance engender love and hope. They much prefer it when we brood in solitude, despairing and alone.\n\nWhich reminds me...one of the things we should do is brood about the enemy s ideology (), for while we try to discern his  ideological goals,  the enemy is busy pulling on his boots, and his boots are made with hobnails, with heel irons, and equipped with toecaps of steel.\n\nFinally, it does not matter who heads up the authoritarian state: a bully boy like Mussolini, a strutting coprophiliac like Hitler, a Napoleonic pig like Stalin, or a brainless dancing bear like Trump. Whatever the current incarnation of  Big Brother  may be, the goal is always the same:\nShow more",

            "content": "WAR IS PEACE.\n\nFREEDOM IS SLAVERY.\n\nIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.\n\nThose words keep sounding in my head since I read this book. Gosh, probably the most haunting not to mention frightening book I've ever read. 1984 should also be included in the horror genre.\n\n1984 describes a Utopia. Not Thomas More's version of Utopia, but this is one is the antithesis, i.e. Dystopia. Imagine living in a country, whose leaders apply a totalitarian system in regulating their citizen, in the most extreme ways, which make Hitler, Mao, Stalin and that old bloke in look like sissies.\n\nWorking, eating, drinking, sleeping, talking, thinking, procreating...in short living, all are controlled by the state. Any hint of obedience or dislike can be detected by various state apparatus such as the Thought Police, telescreen, or even your children, who will not hesitate to betray you to the authorities. Even language is modified in such ways that you cannot express yourself, since individualism is a crime.\n\nThe past is controlled, rewritten into something that will strengthen the incumbent ruler. Who controls the past, controls the future. Who controls the present, controls the past. There is no real truth. The \"truth\" is what the state says it is. Black is white, 2+2=5, if the state says so.\n\nThe world in 1984 is divided into three states, originated from the ashes from World War II: Oceania (British Isles, the Americas, Pacific, Australia), Eurasia (Europe & Russia), and Eastasia (the rest of it). Continuous warfare between those three (who hold similar ideologies) is required to keep the society's order and peace. Si vis pacem para bellum. That's describes the first slogan.\n\nThe second slogan, freedom is slavery, means the only way to be free is by letting you lose yourself and to be integrated within the Party. That way, you'll be indestructible and immortal.\n\nIgnorance is strength, means the division on high, middle, low classes in society will never be changed. The middle wants to be the high and they'll act \"on behalf of the low\" to dethrone the high. Afterwards, a new middle class arises, all will change except the low. The high and middle make and uphold the law, the low (proletarian) is just too stupid to revolt. The state maintains its structure by torture, intimidation, violence, and brainwashing.\n\nBlimey, Orwell's Animal Farm is already depressing, but 1984 gives \"depression\" a new meaning, at least for me.\nShow more",

            "content": "In George Orwell's 1984, Winston Smith is an open source developer who writes his code offline because his ISP has installed packet sniffers that are regulated by the government under the Patriot Act. It's really for his own protection, though. From, like, terrorists and DVD pirates and stuff. Like every good American, he drinks Coca-Cola and his processed food has desensitized his palate to all but four flavors: sweet, salty-so-that-you-will-drink-more-coca-cola, sweet, and Cooler Ranch!(tm). His benevolent overlords have provided him with some war happening somewhere for some reason so that he, and the rest of the population, can be sure that the government is really in his best interests. In fact, the news always has some story about Paris Hilton or yet another white girl who has been abducted by some evil bastard who is biologically wired by 200,000 years of human evolution to fuck 12-year-olds, but is socially conditioned to be obsessed with sex, yet also to feel guilty about it. This culminates into a distorted view of sexuality, and results in rape and murder, which both make for very good news topics. This, too, is in Winston's best interests because, while fear is healthy, thinking *too* much about his own mortality is strictly taboo, as it may lead to something dangerously insightful, and he might lose his taste for Coca Cola and breast implants. The television also plays on his fears of the unknown by exaggerating stereotypes of minorities and homosexuals, under the guise of celebrating \"diversity\", but even these images of being ghetto-fabulous and a lisping interior designer actually exist solely to promote racism and homophobia, which also prove to be efficient distractions.\n\nFor some reason, Winston gets tired of eating recycled Pop Tarts and eating happy pills and pretending to be interested in sports and manufactured news items. But, in the end, they fix him and he's happy again. Or something.\nShow more",

            "content": "1984 is not a particularly good novel, but it is a very good essay. On the novel front, the characters are bland and you only care about them because of the awful things they live through. As a novel all the political exposition is heavyhanded, and the message completely overrides any sense of storytelling. As an essay, the points it makes can be earthshaking. It seems everyone who has so much as gotten a parking ticket thinks he lives in a 1984-dystopia. Every administration that reaches for power, injures civil liberties or collaborates too much with media is accused of playing Big Brother. These are the successes of 's paranoia, far outliving its original intent as a battery against where Communism was going (Orwell was a severely disappointed Marxist), and while people who compare their leaders to Big Brother are usually overreaching themselves and speak far away from Orwell's intent and vision, it is a useful catchcloth for dissent. Like so many immortalized books with a social vision, 's actual substance is so thin that its ideologies and fear-mongering aspects can be stretched and skewed to suit the readers. If you'd like a better sense of the real world and Orwell's intents, rather than third-hand interpretations of his fiction, then his is highly recommended.\n\n\n\nShow more",

Why are we born? Why do we die? Why do we spend so much time between wearing digital watches? For all the answers stick your thumb to the stars. And don't forget to bring a towel!",

Hitchhiker's began on radio, and developed into a \"trilogy\" of five books (which sold more than fifteen million copies during his lifetime) as well as a television series, a comic book series, a computer game, and a feature film that was completed after Adams' death. The series has also been adapted for live theatre using various scripts; the earliest such productions used material newly written by Adams. He was known to some fans as Bop Ad (after his illegible signature), or by his initials \"DNA\".\n\nIn addition to , Douglas Adams wrote or co-wrote three stories of the science fiction television series Doctor Who and served as Script Editor during the seventeenth season. His other written works include the Dirk Gently novels, and he co-wrote two Liff books and , itself based on a radio series. Adams also originated the idea for the computer game , which was produced by a company that Adams co-founded, and adapted into a novel by Terry Jones. A posthumous collection of essays and other material, including an incomplete novel, was published as in 2002.\n\nHis fans and friends also knew Adams as an environmental activist and a lover of fast cars, cameras, the Macintosh computer, and other \"techno gizmos\".\n\nToward the end of his life he was a sought-after lecturer on topics including technology and the environment."

            "content": "In my experience, readers either love Adams' books or quickly put them down. I, for example, quite literally worship the words Adams puts on the page, and have read the Hitchhiker's Trilogy so many times that I have large tracts of it memorized. But both my wife and father couldn't get past book one: the former because she found it too silly, and the latter because he found the writing to be more about \"the author's personality\" than plot and character.\n\nWhatever.\n\nThe first three books in the Hitchhiker's Trilogy--, , and --are inspired lunacy. The ideas, plots, puns, jokes, and phrases that fill their pages have influenced an entire generation of not only writers, but people from all fields. For instance: the Babel Fish software that translates foreign websites for you is named after a species of fish that Adams created in book one; you can find dozens of recipes online for Pan-Galactic Gargle Blasters; the chess computer Deep Thought that lost two matches to Gary Kasparov in 1989 was named after a computer in book one; and seriously, who hasn't heard that the answer to life, the universe, and everything is 42? (For more of these, consult wikipedia.org's entry on \" Cultural References\".) Chances are, if you're reading these books for the first time, you'll be surprised to see how many everyday things were named after Adams' creations.\n\nThe books aren't, of course, without their problems. Adams himself admitted that the Trilogy had, and I paraphrase, a long beginning, a long conclusion, and not much in the middle (though I can't remember where I read that). He was also regularly accused of writing for the sake of cranking out one-liners. The books as a whole jump about like a manic puppy on methamphetamines, and there are at least a few jokes in there that will completely fly over the heads of any readers who lack a basic comprehension of quantum physics.\n\nDespite this, the Hitchhiker's Trilogy remains as the single most entertaining and enjoyable series of books I've ever read--a position they've occupied for some fifteen years. Adams' wit and wisdom still baffle me in their greatness, and he remains to this day one of only two authors who can regularly, consistently make me howl with laughter (the other being Terry Pratchett). Readers beware: if the Adams bug infects you, you will have it for life. And you'll never be sorry you let it bite.\nShow more",

            "content": "The universe is a joke.\n\nEven before I was shown the meaning of life in a dream at 17 (then promptly forgot it because I thought I smelled pancakes), I knew this to be true--and yet, I have always felt a need to search for the truth, that nebulous, ill-treated creature. Adams has always been, to me, to be a welcome companion in that journey.\n\nBetween the search for meaning and the recognition that it's all a joke in poor taste lies Douglas Adams, and, luckily for us, he doesn't seem to mind if you lie there with him. He's a tall guy, but he'll make room.\n\nFor all his crazed unpredictability, Adams is a powerful rationalist. His humor comes from his attempts to really think through all the things we take for granted. It turns out it takes little more than a moment's questioning to burst our preconceptions at the seams, yet rarely does this stop us from treating the most ludicrous things as if they were perfectly reasonable.\n\nIt is no surprise that famed atheist Richard Dawkins found a friend and ally in Adams. What is surprising is that people often fail to see the rather consistent and reasonable philosophy laid out by Adams' quips and absurdities. His approach is much more personable (and less embittered) than Dawkins', which is why I think of Adams as a better face for rational materialism (which is a polite was of saying 'atheism').\n\nReading his books, it's not hard to see that Dawkins is tired of arguing with uninformed idiots who can't even recognize when a point has actually been made. Adams' humanism, however, stretched much further than the contention between those who believe, and those who don't.\n\nWe see it from his protagonists, who are not elitist intellectuals--they're not even especially bright--but damn it, they're trying. By showing a universe that makes no sense and having his characters constantly question it, Adams is subtly hinting that this is the natural human state, and the fact that we laugh and sympathize shows that it must be true.\n\nIt's all a joke, it's all ridiculous. The absurdists might find this depressing, but they're just a bunch of narcissists, anyhow. Demanding the world make sense and give you purpose is rather self centered when it already contains toasted paninis, attractive people in bathing suits, and Euler's Identity. I say let's sit down at the bar with the rabbi, the priest, and the frog and try to get a song going. Or at least recognize that it's okay to laugh at ourselves now and again. It's not the end of the world.\n\nIt's just is a joke, but some of us are in on it.\nShow more",

At the local pub, he encounters his enigmatic friend Ford Prefect. Prefect, a galactic hitchhiker, is leaving the Earth, and taking Dent with him. A minor nuisance; apparently the Earth is just about to be demolished to make way for an interstellar freeway. Dent s realization is instant, several billions of people are going to have a very bad day.\n\nThis is the most ridiculously funny book I ve ever read. Although that may be because it was my very first of the kind. I think the hype is very well deserved, if you are into that kind of humor. I lost track of how many times it made me laugh, and I m not really an easy person to make laugh. Outrageously silly sci-fi humor in every single chapter. An unforgettable ride through an absurdity of worlds scattered along the vast craziness of an unfathomable galaxy.\n\nThe movie (2005) is a mediocre adaptation at best; even with a stellar cast like Rockwell, Deschanel and Malkovich. It s not nearly as funny as the book, not by a long shot, at least for me. It doesn t make it justice and is not exactly faithful to the original work. And sadly, you just can t bring down the magnificently complex absurdity of Douglas writing to cinematic dialog without losing much of its original magic.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n:\n[2007] [193p] [Humor] [Highly Recommendable] [Outrageously ridiculous] [Wonderfully crazy galaxy] [Never forget Marvin] [\n]\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n     \n      [2.5]\n     \n     \n     \n      [2.5]\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nArthur Dent tiene un mal d a, su casa est  a punto de ser derribada porque est  en el camino de la construcci n de una nueva carretera.

It does not affect me on any deep emotional level and this kind of quirky sci-fi comedy is just not really my thing. However, that being said, Adams' has some of the best quotes EVER (not all of these are from this exact book):\n\n\n\"In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.\"\n\n\n\n\"For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much the wheel, New York, wars and so on whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man for precisely the same reasons.\"\n\n\n\n\"The Guide says there is an art to flying\", said Ford, \"or rather a knack. The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.\"\n\n\n\n\"A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools.\"\n\n\n\n\"Would it save you a lot of time if I just gave up and went mad now?\"\n\n\n\n\"The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't.\"\n\n\n\nShow more",

            "content": "A work that showed humanity its insignificance and that madness is a general, entertaining trait in the universe.\n\nOne of the greatest milestones of the rare Sci-Fi comedy hybrids, although it s losing quality after the first 3 parts. Fantasy seems to be more prone to comedy than Sci-Fi, I don t know why that s the fact. I would tend to call it kind of Terry Pratchett in space, because of the unique wit, just without the stamina for so many parts. Adams dying in a fitness center of a heart attack comes in here too, although he already stopped continuing the series years before.\n\nMore sheer fun than the rest of the serious\nIt s just hilarious and very clever, using different comedy tropes in space, not for science! One of these ideas one has once in a lifetime, in Adam's case mixed with talent. It s mostly constructed by\n\nRunning gags, some sci-fi elements, and comedy characters.\nThereby, the wacky protagonists construct the laughs with slapstick, some deeper stuff, and general strangeness. The underlying criticism level isn t very high in the first part, which can mostly be seen as pure entertainment.\n\nSo successful because it s so easy to read\nThere is better, more ironic, and more complex sci-fi out there, but nothing as pleasant as Adam's work. No need to think too hard or get depressed about human nature, no info dump and worldbuilding overkills, just characters, puns, and gags mixed with some dept and\n\nThe second and third part of the series include some of the best indirect social criticism too.\nBut it sadly doesn t improve after that, I ve read until the fifth one and Adams just can t live up to the expectations anymore, starts recycling his schemes, and just isn t as compelling as in the original trilogy.

There's a French movie called \"Rrrrrrr\" (similar humour to Monty Pyton) and I've had way more fun using the jokes out of context with friends than I did actually watching the movie. Recommending it was always a bit weird because it's just an okay movie but... the jokes are funny afterwards.\n\nThis summarizes exactly how I feel about this book!\nShow more",

However, he has more things to worry about because the Earth is about to be demolished to make way for the galactic highway. Arthur Dent and his friend Ford Perfect are scooped up from Earth just a second before it is wiped out. The two of them travel through the galaxy and encounter many different people along the way including a depressed robot.\n\nThe first half of the book was really funny. I was reading this with a family member, and we both were laughing out loud every couple of minutes. The second half of the book was less funny because it was more plot driven. This book won't be for everyone, because some of the humor is a bit dry. I haven't seen the movie yet, but I am not sure if the jokes will really translate that well to the big screen.\n\nOverall, it was a quick read and pretty enjoyable. However, as mentioned earlier, the pacing felt a bit off but keep in mind this book was written in the 1970's before the 8 second attention spans developed by YouTube.\n\n2023 Reading Schedule\nJan Alice in Wonderland\nFeb Notes from a Small Island\nMar Cloud Atlas\nApr On the Road\nMay The Color Purple\nJun Bleak House\nJul Bridget Jones s Diary\nAug Anna Karenina\nSep The Secret History\nOct Brave New World\nNov A Confederacy of Dunces\nDec The Count of Monte Cristo\n\n\nShow more",

            "content": "Please, before anything... DON'T PANIC.\n\n\nThis review is harmless, well mostly harmless.\n\nI think that one of the things that one has to keep in mind while reading this book is that it was written in 1979. Having this important factor in perspective, it's quite astonishing the vision of Douglas Adams, the author, presenting a lot of visionary elements, starting with the very \"book inside the book\", I mean , since it's presented as an electronic book. which now it's a very common way to read a lot of books now. Also, he mentioned stuff like \"touch-sensitive screens\" that yet again, it's now something introduced in our daily lives. Science-Fiction, the good science fiction is defined by being visionary in the moment to be published and a fact, years later. Just like Verne's work predicting events like space rockets and nuclear submarines.\n\n\n\nObviously, beside the mesmering tecnology stuff that he predicted, the signature style here is his remarkable sense of humor, sense of humor. In literature and pop culture in general, there were been unforgettable examples of computers like the cold HAL from and the noble K.I.T.T. from , also robots like the loyal R2-D2 from and the logical robots from short story collection. However, nothing of that can prepare you to the experience of meeting \"Eddie\", the Main Computer of the Heart of Gold spaceship or Marvin, the Paranoid Android. This is one of the best traits of Douglas Adams' wit in the development of artificial intelligence. I wasn't surprised since some months ago, I read by Gareth Roberts but based on the 's unaired script written by Douglas Adams where you find another priceless example of a computer with a personality that only Adams is able to develop. You laugh and laugh with them not only because they's funny but also they are truly logical as artifical intelligences in their way to react to situations. Adams' impact of how presenting artificial intelligence can be found too in another novel of , by Jonathan Morris, where the author showed how well he learned Adams' lessons.\n\n\n\nI believe that Douglas Adams' involvement in the production of the iconic British sci-fi TV series as script editor and writer of three stories, it was fated since I found remarkable similarities on the premises of both works, this novel and the TV series. Both has a peculiar fellow who stole certain machine and along with companions is travelling around. So, it wouldn't a surprise that he got some inspiration since was widely known since 1963 specially on its native country, England. Of course, his participation on another British TV institution like was a relevant point for Adams to explode his humoristic potential.\n\n\n\nIt's possible that people unfamiliar with Adams' work could think that since this is a novel with comedy, they could think that it can't be a \"serious\" science-fiction book. However, the brilliance of this novel is its capacity of offering smart humor while using scientific concepts like the theory of faster-than-light objects. Even you won't be able to fight against his priceless explanation behind the UFOs' sightings.\n\nWithout spoiling anything, I think that my only reason of getting off a star in my rating of this great novel was its lacking a proper closure. I understand that this the first book in a trilogy of five books (yes, you read correctly, it wasn't a mistake) so the adventures and mysteries will continue in the second book . However, it was quite unsettling when you are having the time of your life reading it and the book just stopped to have words. I describe it like that since I didn't feel an ending. It was indeed just like the impossibility of not finding more words in the book. What I can give to Adams is that that was quite but in my opinion, quite unlikely way to just \"ending\" this book.\n\nCertainly I want to read the rest of this great of books. (Yes, yet again, you read well, and it isn't a mistake)\n\n\nShow more",

Then I accidentally came across an interview of where he discussed his Hitchhiker s-Guide-inspired Design Philosophy and That, at last, convinced me to read this book. And it was an absolute joy to read.\n\n\n\nFor knowing more about it. I am sharing the excerpts from Elon Musk's interview here.\n\n\nHere Elon beautifully lays out the philosophical points from Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy, which have shaped the way he thinks through tough engineering challenges.\n\n\n1.\nAs Hitchhiker s Guide teaches us, if you are given access to the Universe s most powerful supercomputer a system that can answer any question you throw at it don t waste its time with a question you haven t properly thought through. The same goes for a beautiful human brain.\nWhen approaching any challenge, first ask yourself,  Am I asking the right question?  Alternatively,  Am I being asked the right question? \n\n2.\nThe climax of the first book in the series focuses on relaying this lesson to its readers: If you don t understand the question in the first place, you won t understand the answer it produces.\n\n3.\nThe world of rocket science comes with a load of constraints: Time, physical, budgetary, the list goes on. But, Elon warns,  Don t design to your constraints without calling into question those constraints. \n\n4.\nWe all find ourselves in the midst of a task that suddenly seems silly.  Why am I doing this?  We are creatures of habit, and we are great at following orders. But, sometimes, we forget that orders come from creatures of habit. And, sometimes, habits must be broken in the name of efficiency and progress. SpaceX s extremely fast-paced innovation makes it clear that they are great at putting this lesson into practice.\n\n5.\nTo be a great leader, you have to understand the trickle-down effect of your organizational errors. They will flow all the way down the chain, injecting themselves right into your products and services.\nThat goes for any level of organization, all the way up to whole societies. Starting on page 1, Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy does a wonderful job poking fun at the absurdity of error-filled bureaucratic processes that trickle all the way down from a government body, forming persistent issues in the daily lives of its citizens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more",

Always entertaining and so absurdly profound!\n~~~\n\nDouglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is an entertaining romp through the galaxy. It's a book I've read several times (first in high school); however, after reading Kurt Vonnegut's most overtly science fiction novel, The Sirens of Titan, it almost felt like a fresh experience. Of course, Vonnegut and Adams are very different writers. Still, the influence of Vonnegut is evident in Adams' seminal novel of nerd culture. The absurdity of the human condition explored in Sirens (something which Vonnegut refuses to take seriously but can't treat as a punchline either) gets a funny and entertaining twist in Adams' work. While I view Sirens as a better novel, it took Adams to turn that absurdity into such an entertaining adventure.\nShow more",

Not 42 times, however. There are only so many hours in the day.\n\nI think it was a hit. But we must always remember... Don't Panic.\n\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nI'm a firm believer that every budding reader ought to read this book first so they can be utterly and completely ruined for literature for the rest of their lives.\n\nOf course, if you're an older reader, with experience and verve when it comes to words, you might also be completely ruined for literature for the rest of your life, too, but I'm not counting you. In fact, I don't care about you.\n\nI have a towel.\n\nAnd I know how to USE IT. It's almost, but not quite entirely unlike having a clue.\n\n\nFortunately, I, myself had been totally ruined for literature early on in my life and I think I might have read this book around seven or eight times before I got the idea that nothing else I would ever read would quite stack up to it, and afterward, I just decided to become Marvin and assume that the whole world was not quite worth living.\n\nBut, again, fortunately, I remembered that I was an Earthling and I could replace most of my cognitive centers with \"What?\" and get along quite nicely. So that's what I did and ever since I've been reading normal books and saying \"What?\" quite happily.\n\nYou SEE? Happy endings DO happen. As long as you're not a pot of Petunias. Of course, that story would take WAY too long to tell.\n\nI think I want to grab a bite to eat. Maybe I ought to meet the meat.\nShow more",

When I was growing up I remember watching the BBC TV show and playing the text adventure on my Commodore 64 (yes, I am getting old). Before I actually read it, lots of my friends recommended it and the cool, edgy people all loved it (basically, the hipsters of the 90s!   )\n\nWhen I finally read it, it seemed a bit dry to me. Perhaps that was the famous dry British humor? Also, it felt like Adams was trying to include a joke in every sentence. I started to think that perhaps the TV show and the text adventure streamlined the humor and made it more accessible to me.\n\nI do think that a lot of people will like this one and sing its praises - and you don't even need to be cool and edgy! But if you like your British humor in controlled, coherent doses, you may have the same experience as me.\nShow more",

            "content": "What a weird little book.\n\nSomething I'll do, almost immediately after finishing a book, is Google the heck out of the genre it belongs to. For example, after finishing Furiously Happy, I wanted to find a book that would make me laugh as much as it did. When in doubt, turn to Google. I have googled \"most funny books\" , \"funny fiction books\" and \" comedy books\". Each time, this was one of the top results. And since, I got Audible for Christmas, I thought I would give it a try. (But also because Google is shoving it down my throat.)\n\nI'm still not totally sure how I feel about it. I keet waffling. One chapter, I'd be laughing and thinking I would definitely rate it 5 Stats but the next, I would be bored and wanted to rate it 3. (I decided on 3.5 stars).\n\nThis book is described as sci-fi AND comedy. A very very weird combo. I like both of those genres separately but together they were just weird. I love chocolate and I love grilled cheese but would I put them together? Heck, no. (Well, I might but I've been known to have weird food combos. Cheese and chocolate. Eggs and syrup. Apple's and chips.)\n\nAside from the genres, the plot was very creative. They story open a with the end. The end of earth. Two aliens and two aliens the travel the Universe and hilarity ensues. That's all fine and good but then the book just ended. I can only describe at as like when your walking and reading and you run into a wall and your nose gets all scraped up. (Not that that's happened to me or anything   )\n\nAll in all, I have very mixed feelings. I loved the idea and the humor. I also loved the sci-fi aspect but when all of that was combined it was not all that great\n\n\n| | | | | |\n\n\nBottom Line:\n3.5 Stars: Weird, but funny\nAge Recommendation: 11+ (Slight cursing, violence)\nFor fans of: 5th Wave, Furiously Happy\nCover: 5/10\nPlot: 6/10\nCharacter: 8/10\n\n*******\nUpdate: it did but what the heck was that ending?!?

            "content": "Review of the audio, read by Stephen Fry:\n\nOverall, Fry earns a solid 'B+' for his rendition of the classic Hitchhiker's Guide. Fry has the perfect 'narrator' voice, and I generally enjoyed most of his character voices. Ford Prefect often has a rakish tone, his reading of Arthur Dent is note-perfect clueless, and Zaphod Beeblebrox has a deliciously smarmy confidence. It was a bit of a revelation to find Marvin more amusing in audio than when I read the book, although I feel like Fry might have given him a tad too much despondent enthusiasm. His reading of the Vogon gibberish as the Babel fish was inserted and translated it into English had me laughing.\n\nNo, my biggest problem is that I think sometimes Fry got a little too involved in the story, and his character voices bled together. He'd suddenly remember who was speaking, and pull Zaphod out of dashing Ford territory and back into cocky confidence, but it was often enough and in dialogue enough that I definitely noticed as a trend, not an instance.\n\nWell, no matter; still utterly engaging. There was a distracting formatting issue where the pause between chapters must have been edited out between the end of the previous chapter, Fry reading the chapter heading (ex. \"Chapter Five\") and the continuation of the story, there was no pause at all.\n\nThough Audible claims this is unabridged, I either spaced out a few moments (entirely possible) or it isn't, quite. I'll have to give it another listen-through as I'm driving. But I'm definitely enthusiastic about moving on to if Fry is reading.\nShow more",

            "content": " You know,\" said Arthur, \"it's at times like this, when I'm trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse, and about to die of asphyxiation in deep space that I really wish I'd listened to what my mother told me when I was young.\"\n\"Why, what did she tell you?\"\n\"I don't know, I didn't listen. \n\nDid this make you laugh already? Fine, because the rest of Douglas Adams' famous novel includes many more of those humorous elements.\n\nI have a very difficult personal history with Sci-Fi novels; some of them I could appreciate but not enjoy; some I could appreciate but got bored with them very quickly; but was the first Sci-Fi novel which ever made me simultaneously appreciate, enjoy even love the book. Love is a strong word, but if a book is filled with sentences like  The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't  or  Anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job  or  My capacity for happiness you could fit into a matchbox without taking out the matches first , then I simply can't help but fall in love with it.\n\n\n\n\n\nI could go on and quote the entire book now, that's how much fun it was reading this and that's how quotable the book is. But Douglas Adams didn't only attempt (and succeed) to write this groundbreaking approach to the science fiction genre, he was also able to make you think a lot about several important questions: Adams intentionally answers these questions in rather absurd ways, mainly because it is impossible to find ultimate answers and definitions for these topics. But those are all questions everyone has already asked themselves, and Adams isn't afraid to tackle them in a way that the reader can't help but laugh about it.\n\n\nIf you haven't read this book yet, perhaps because you are afraid of the Sci-Fi genre (which I was as well, until I started my adventures with Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect, Marvin and all the others in this book): then don't hesitate to read it. But don't be mistaken, Adams' book is rather an episodic account of several random adventures in the cosmic space, and for me it was mostly Adams' writing style which it was impossible to resist. He lures his readers into the story and before you even realize it, you are probably already laughing.\n\nAnd don't forget to bring your towel!\nShow more",

On the bright side (by the way), it does not matter either. Earth too will no longer be, soon just billions of inconsequential floating pieces scattered throughout the cosmos, no one left to remember. The powers of the galaxy have decided this little insignificant, dull planet at the edge of the Milky Way must go. A byperspatial express route is being built, Earth is in the path no big deal to the rest of the universe, just a few souls disappear think of the convenience to others , people... His friend drops by, Mr.Ford Prefect and finds Arthur lying in the mud in front of the bulldozers, and asks him what's new ? And can he go to the local pub for a drink, they must talk... Seems okay to Dent, but first the intelligent man gets a gentleman's solemn sacred promise, from a bureaucrat (who shall remain nameless), that his house will still be standing when he gets back. Even has Mr.Prosser, replace him in the dirt (I can never keep a secret). After a few drinks which relaxes Arthur, Ford tell's his friend he's an alien from a another planet in the vicinity of the great star Betelgeuse, just 600 light-years away. Dent always thought Prefect was an eccentric man but this being England, perfectly permissible, goes on to explain he's a researcher for something called, \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\". A weird sound emulates from the outside disrupting this enlightening discussion, Arthur jumps up runs out the door and sees that there are no more gentlemen in the world now. Home gone, but the over excited man starts calling the wrecking crew unkind names. Such language (I will not repeat them, in mixed company, besides this is a family site ). People should be calm, always calm nothing to be concerned about, remember you are English...Looking up, odd yellow streaks in the sky Dent wonders, Ford did say the Earth would be destroyed today but he is strange...Stiff upper lip ...But something is occurring, though. Ford arrives and the noise level rises also...A short time later the waking, Dent...Mr.Dent, comes to in the dark in an alien spaceship , one of those that vaporized his not quite beloved planet, with Ford there... Evil green, and very ugly aliens the Vogons who like to torture people by reciting bad poetry, I mean really bad Vogon poetry, resulting in captives welcoming death, rather than listen to another word... Captain Jeltz hates hitchhikers, and Ford had a devise to enter the ship, secretly. But the clever friends say they loved the excruciating poem, of the captain's; obvious lying, the angry poet has the two rudely thrown off the craft into space, without... spacesuits...these aliens, are barbarians... They can hold their breaths for thirty seconds, so don't worry... A miracle, on the 29th second, they're saved by the President of the galaxy , in a stolen vessel. And the runaway politician ( surprisingly not exactly honest), Zaphod Beeblebrox is on board, so is his two heads and three arms, with his girlfriend Trillian and Marvin, the paranoid robot, don't talk to it, he's very depressing, you would want to crush him, with your bare hands ... As the semi cousin (what's that?) of the president, Ford Prefect is in luck. All the galaxy, are after the Heart of Gold, the new spaceship which can cross the Milky Way, in a flash, on ship the greedy, seek the legendary, lost and fabulously rich planet, Magratha. In the vastness of the whole endless Universe everything's is possible, except an android like Marvin...Remember the Guide's motto, \"Don't Panic\"...\nShow more",

A man is secretly taken to another planet. So enjoy I say.\n\nIt's filled with weirdos because most of them are beings from somewhere else (to keep it subtle or to make it worse) and the story is chaotic and funny as heck.\n\nBut really though, reading this series talking about demolishing the Earth during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic did made me question my choice of books.\n\n(And every book I pick up these days are either too depressing or stressed the heck out of me. I question my choices. Yes, I do that a lot these days.)\n\nI was going crazy trying to calm down and understand what was going on in the first few chapters. But then chapter 6 started and there's no going back. Of course, we gotta read the first 5 chapters to get this feeling.\n\nI love this chapter! Funny yet the discussion going on in there. Fun! Faith vs Man.\n\nMy favourite character would be Ford. He would be someone I would want to punch in the face but cannot survive without.\n\nArthur. Oh Arthur. You remind me of us humans that I keep getting all the second-hand embarassment whenever you appear.\n\nTrillian. The way her character is reminds me of some of the most calmest yet intriguing people. I like how her vibes scream sarcasm towards Gaphod, the semi-cousin of Ford.\n\nAnd what the hell is wrong with Grunthos (yes, that's a real fictional character's name... Real and fictional.) Torture yourself with the poems by Poet Master Grunthos. (My Favourite Bathtime Gurgles....yes, get the hint.) The horror! I cried laughing there!\n\nAnd you will meet a few more characters. Almost philosophical ones I would say.\n\nMarvin, you will be remembered.\n\nThe more pages you turn, the more you will enjoy the story. There's nothing normal here. Because, of course, it didn't happen on our planet. Let your imagination have its exercise and be tickled with an imaginary world somewhere out there.\n\nThe entire read reminds me so much of the nerds Sheldon Cooper, Lennerd, Howard and Raj. Like they have written a story together finally!\n\n(The irony though that the book series happened years before the show.)\n\nAnother story there, Magrathea. It could happen. Myth?\n\nLove the space time I had with the first book!\n\nParts like this out of nowhere got me laughing out loud\n(\"Ah...! What's happening?it thought.\n\nEr, excuse me, who am I?\n\nHello?\n\nWhy am I here? What's my purpose in life?\n\nWhat do you mean by who am I?\")\n\nOf course, it's not always about the human and humanlike beings here.\nI just wish no fictional animal was harmed in the story.\n\nThe end of chapter 21 made me quite emotional. I wish I never have to say such lines. Ever.\n\nAnd (bam!) the chapters that followed this until the end made this read a perfect read for me. I am telling you this is the kind of book the more pages you read the more you get invested.\n\nI kept telling myself \"this is so chaotic\", \"do I need to be worried about how worried I am now while reading this crazy story?\" and \"I want to go there\". Actually the whole story felt rather claustrophobic too.\n\nI really love the last few chapters more. It's everything you need to think about you, the world you live in and what might be actually happening as opposed to what we are made to believe all our lives.\n\nAnd human, be very scared of mice. (Now I know why we go crazy sht seeing mice!)\n\n\"Resistance is useless.\"\n   Just pick up this book. It's funny at first but then you will know it ain't so funny.\nShow more",

I'm giving it a 3, which means I still liked it... but unfortunately, I wasn't as fond of the humor as most people are.\n\nThis was a book club selection from about 6 or 7 years ago. We agreed to read just the first one in the series. And it was the first science-fiction novel we took on. I was excited. Several had already read it but wanted to again.\n\nI'm generally a fan of crazy humor. I love Spaceballs, the movie. I kinda liken it to that, but for some reason, this wasn't as funny as I felt everyone said it was. Tons of laughs. Many great lines. The characters were memorable. I'm pretty sure there are a few movie or cartoon adaptions of it.\n\nAnd I honestly would recommend that everyone read it -- even non SF fans. There are parts you will totally enjoy. But it's hard to get into for a non-SF reader right from the beginning. My first reactions were \"Oh that's not possible...\" But then I realized I wasn't reading a typical novel, so I suspended the lil' bit o' grouch in me... and I was able to enjoy it.\n\n\n\nVery imaginative. Lots of cool commentary on life as other people would see it. A fair approach for someone new to the universe, so to speak.\n\nI may go back and read it now that I'm older and have read a few other SF and fantasy books. I'm curious... what's the huge appeal for others about this book?\n\n\n\n\nFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT. First the book review goes on Goodreads, and then I send it on over to my WordPress blog at , where you'll also find TV & Film reviews, the revealing and introspective 365 Daily Challenge and lots of blogging about places I've visited all over the world.

            "content": "This is another instance where it's daunting to write a review because the novel is well-known and loved by millions of people. As a Sci-Fi/Fantasy reader, it's embarrassing that I've only read this once, and I've waited 'till 2016 to read this. I'm glad that I can finally say that I've read this. I've finally read and enjoyed one of the most influential books of the sci-fi genre.\n\nI understand all the buzz regarding this novel. This is the first time in my whole life that I laughed out loud while reading a novel. I've never believed that a novel could be humorous enough to make me elicit more than a giggle or a smile. This novel changed my perception of humor novels in general. I finally have faith in that genre, and an even stronger desire to read more important Sci-Fi novels.\n\nI don't see the need to make a short summary of the novel. You can find other reviews that did that. I'm writing this review to express my feelings toward the novel, and the journey that I had with it. Speaking of journey, it was a damn short one. I honestly hate gigantic novels, but it's always fulfilling to finish one if the book is great. This book I can consider amazing, but too short.\n\nAside from the humor, I enjoyed the wittiness of the novel and the author himself. The ideas he incorporated in the novel are vital for the readers to understand. It may be a humor novel, but it's more than that as a whole.\n\nThe characters are funny and well-developed. The main ones managed to make me laugh. Ford reminds me of Sheldon Cooper from The Big Bang Theory, and Arthur as Leonard Hofstadter. This is like a classic Big Bang theory episode, or maybe The Big Bang theory is a modern Hitchhiker.\n\nThe plot is not that complex, but it is interesting. I'm always interested to read about other planets in the galaxy, even if it's just fiction. I like to imagine that there are hundreds or thousands of worlds out there in the galaxy. Funny thing that the Earth blew up in this novel. Funnier that they considered Earth as a funny name in the beginning.\n\nAll the ideologies Adams incorporated here are interesting to me. How some animals are superior and manipulated us, or how the Earth was all a project of some aliens. It's funny and vastly interesting. I can't wait to read the other books in the series.\n\n4.5/5 stars. I decided to round it down because while the novel truly entertained me, it still lacked something and made me think twice about the 5-star rating.\nShow more",

            "content": "I have spent almost six hours in the delightful company of Stephen Fry, reading the satirical science fiction classic with incredible skill and humour.\n\nAs I had read it before, I had to bow to Fry s ability to speak the strange, evocative names of the characters without giving away his amusement more than with a tiny rise in the voice.\n\nThe story starts with a bleak outlook on life on Earth, of course. While Arthur Dent, a regular human being, is in a rage over a bulldozer which is about to tear down his house to make space for a bypass road, a slightly bigger construction project in space causes an alien company to erase the whole planet Earth for the same reason. Gone is our home, just moments before the extraterrestrial company receives information to the effect that the demolition of Earth is unnecessary.\n\nWell, it is not the first time unnecessary things have happened in the construction business, and Earth is not that important anyway, from a universal standpoint, as Arthur realises while travelling with an alien journalist researching for a book called  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy . After 15 years of studying Earth, he is able to expand the entry on our planet by adding a  mostly  to the previous one-word comment summing up our entire globe:  harmless . Arthur, reflecting on the loss of Trafalgar Square and McDonalds as the planet is destroyed, has a moment of hardship accepting that all that is left of his previous home now is a redundant note on it being  mostly harmless .\n\nThus thrown on an odyssey in space, the pair makes acquaintances of diverse kinds, always learning something new about how not to take life too seriously, while still trying to understand it. One fabulous scene features the travellers on a hostile space ship, subject to the so-called vogons  Poetry Appreciation Chair, where they are kept in place while inundated without mercy with the unbearably horrific Vogon poetry, the third worst in universe. I imagine it a bit like being strapped to a chair and forced to listen to and appreciate some famous twitter that is produced on our mostly harmless ex-planet.\n\nWhen asked to choose whether they prefer to be thrown into space or to appreciate the value of what they have heard, the two heroes deliver a duet of superb poetry appreciation bullshit bingo, leaving the mean vogon wondering whether he might really have talent after all: but being heartless and cruel, he kicks them out of the spaceship anyway. Escaping certain death yet again, with a second s margin, the hitchhikers are picked up by another ship in an act of major improbability, which is accurately calculated for them.\n\nThe most impressive character in the book is the supercomputer Deep Thought, whose sulking voice is brilliantly interpreted by Stephen Fry. He has a godlike attitude, and is preparing for the arrival of the messiah of computers, which will ultimately trump him, even though it is to be designed by Deep Thought himself.\n\nWhile awaiting the time of the new supercomputer, Deep Thought agrees to give the answer to life, the universe and everything. As the recipients of the answer are not happy with it, not being able to understand what it means, they set out to find the proper question to make sense of it. Deep Thought himself can t do it, and tells them they have to wait for the new messiah computer.\n\nHowever, being inventive, they try different questions that match the answer in the intermediate time, acting very much like true philosophers.\n\nTheir first try is a bit too straightforward:\n\n What is six times seven? \n\nThen they have a touch of genius, and find the perfect interim question for the answer:\n\n How many roads must a man walk down? \n\n Brilliant! \n\n The answer, my friend, is Forty-Two, the answer is Forty-Two! \n\nAll universe must have conspired to make them come up with that deep question for the hard-to-understand answer. It could almost be a song, if you changed the lyrics a bit? Or maybe the kind of horrible Vogonian poetry that ex-Academies would award?\n\nWhile our characters are off to have lunch at the end of the universe, Deep Thought is preparing for the arrival of his son, the new supercomputer. He has given him a name already:\n\n The Earth! \n\nAnd the most intelligent creatures on the old, demolished planet say:\n\n Thank you for all the fish! \n\nDelightfully irreverent journey through the nonsensical human existence!\nShow more",

    "description": "From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity s creation and evolution a #1 international bestseller that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be  human.  One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us? Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas. Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become? Featuring 27 photographs, 6 maps, and 25 illustrations/diagrams, this provocative and insightful work is sure to spark debate and is essential reading for aficionados of Jared Diamond, James Gleick, Matt Ridley, Robert Wright, and Sharon Moalem.",

            "content": "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind is a book bound to appear on a large number of coffee tables and favorite lists, and be picked up even by those who normally would not find the time for reading. It will certainly not be the next A Brief History of Time, which is often named as the world's top unfinished popular bestseller.\n\nBoth A Brief History of Time and Sapiens share a similar, worthy goal - to explain complex issues in a way which can actually be understood and comprehended by most people. Just as aimed at explaining cosmology to a lay audience, aims to provide a readable and concise historical summary of the progress of human evolution - all in under 500 pages.\n\nIs this possible? Of course not - histories of individual countries often take up several volumes, and histories of entire civilizations and ultimately an entire specie would take up hundreds if not thousands of volumes. Because Harari's book is limited to just a single volume (and a relatively short one at that), he has to severely limit his scope to what he considers to be the biggest life-changing developments of our species, which essentially reduces it to a collection of trivia about these events.\n\nBut that's not the true flaw of the book. begins strong enough with a very interesting presentation of early human history and development of early human species, which culminated in the rise and eventual dominance of our own - the Homo Sapiens. However, the rest of the book consists largely of author's own musings and thoughts about the human condition and character - while some of these thoughts I find interesting and agreeable (such as our collective belief in the value of money), one thesis he that he put forward struck me as truly bizarre.\n\nBasically, Harari considers the agricultural revolution to be , which instead of improvement left humans who settled down to farm worse off and more miserable than their nomadic, foraging ancestors. To prove his point, Harari waxes poetics about hunter-gatherers and their daily existence: they lived in egalitarian communes where property and love was freely shared, and were much more adept at survival in the wilderness than their descendants who plowed the fields. Hunter-gatherers had to have a much larger knowledge of their surroundings, and possessed vastly superior mental reflexes and physical dexterity which put future generations to shame. Although we have since gained vast knowledge as a collective, Harari argues that on the individual level ancient foragers were .\n\nFor Harari, our foraging ancestors were not only mental and physical supermen, but also enjoyed a much more comfortable and rewarding lifestyle than all the subsequent peasants, workers and office clerks. They worked fewer hours and since they had no homes, they also had no household chores; this allowed for plenty of free time to play with one another, tell stories and just hang out. Since foraging necessitated exploration, it also provided plenty of adventure: what better thing to do than explore new places to look for cool plants and other edible things? Because they were always on the move and therefore not dependent on a single source of food, hunter-gatherers enjoyed a superior, multi-nutrient diet and were less likely to suffer from hunger and starvation than subsequent agricultural societies, which often depended on a single crop, and not only were receiving much less nutrients but also suffered heavily from famines when their food source failed. Farming? Bah! Humbug.\n\nTrue, there were some drawbacks, Harari reluctantly agrees. Although some lucky souls made it longer, life expectancy averaged only 30 to 40 years. Children dropped dead like flies, and sometimes wild tigers came out of the bushes and ate you and your whole family and tribe. Not to mention that sometimes you and your band wandered and wandered, and the food . Or even worse - the food was there, but so was another tribe which was not exactly keen on sharing their already limited supply. What about this? , says the author, though I do not really understand why, since this is exactly what he appeared to be doing, Ain't that the truth. Sometimes, life is just hard. Rocks fall, everyone dies.\n\nBut agricultural revolution? It sucked, Harari argues. First, he has unnamed (and presumably fictitious) scholars proclaim the development of agriculture as , which . But this is not true - , he says, as . As I mentioned above, Harari states that agricultural revolution made things for farmers - it robbed them from excitement of hunting and gathering by forcing them to settle down next to their fields and perform menial farm work, which strained our joints and spine. Although farming provided a surplus of food it did not provide the farmer with a better diet, robbing us of the diversity of meals experienced by a hunter-gatherer. Farming also failed to provide us with economic security - crops can always fail and lead to hunger, whereas hunter-gatherers can always move on and hunt for other types of food (unless, of course, they do not find any and starve to death). Farmers also had to stay and defend their land if attacked by a hostile group, whereas foragers could always escape to another area, look for food there, and survive (they could, of course, end up not being able to escape -who can fight or run on an empty stomach? - or...not find any food, and starve to death).\n\nSo, what exactly has agriculture ever done for us? Since it has taken so much not only from our fathers but also from from our fathers' fathers, what has it ever given us in return? The aqueduct? Sanitation? And why have humans not returned to hunting and gathering but stubbornly toiled their fields and broke their miserable backs, while they could be climbing trees and camping in the wilderness? The answer is simple: more food allowed women to have children more often, and even though they still died fairly often this time births outpaced deaths several times. Village population increased, and soon entire generations of people no longer remembered the good old days of running in the forests and looking for berries. , Harari writes, .\n\n\nHe goes on to say: .Yet, we are wrong in thinking this, because (though apparently not when it comes to foraging, which was a blast by all accounts - that is, the author's). Harari neglects to mention the exact reason the agricultural revolution took place - farming first arose in places where , and in the long run prevailed as the better option. Hunter-gatherers simply did not choose to one day walk out of the woods and start domesticating animals and plants; they were forced to do that because the environment they were living no longer allowed for foraging to remain a viable option. The Younger Dryas interval in ancient Levant is often linked to the adoption of agriculture in the region, as an example of the first deliberate cultivation of plants. People understood that seeds developed into plants at the time when they desperately needed to increase their food supply in order to survive, and linked one with the other.\n\nIt is interesting that Harari does not only romanticize hunting and gathering, but actually looks at the agricultural revolution and its impact a hunter and gatherer - that is, focusing on the thing that mattered most to our foraging ancient ancestors: food. Hunter-gatherers spend their lives pursuing food; as Harari admits, because of their nomadic lifestyle they had very few possessions, as they were constantly moving around in search for food to sustain them. Food was their driving force; their lives centered around food, as they never had a steady supply of it and always had to hunt and look for more if they were to survive.\n\nIn contrast, agricultural revolution provided humans with a steady and regular supply of food, and or the first time in our history allowed humans to take our minds food and constant travel. The impact of this is monumental and cannot be stressed enough. Basically, without agricultural revolution, our knowledge would be stagnant - as we would simply not have the luxury of time to develop it. Food surplus and settling down allowed humans to more and develop new ideas and technologies, allowing for more efficient farming - which in turn allowed for more time to think and develop even more ideas and technologies. In contrast to general knowledge of our forager ancestors, surplus of food and settler lifestyle allowed for skill specialization, which in turn allowed us to do things beyond their wildest dreams, and become technologically advanced. Basically, I would argue that societies comprised of hunter-gatherers cannot advance and live up to the full human potential - it is impossible to have a truly technologically advanced nomadic society, while it is possible to have a technologically advanced settler society which is able to send some of its members into the world as hunter-gatherers. To put it very simply: hunter-gatherers live in the wilderness, living day to day on what they find or hunt down, while agriculturists discover penicillin, split the atom and fly into space.\n\nAlthough the author later brings up valid concerns about our treatment of animals and abuse of collective power, his rant against agriculture is truly bizarre considering that without it he would not be able to write this very book. It's as if he disregarded the very Sapiens which he aimed to describe, and which has defied his thesis by abandoning hunting and gathering to settle down and farm. Still, there are good parts and certain valuable and interesting insights in this book - it's just a shame that it's tainted with such a weird and contrived chapter.\nShow more",

            "content": " The best-selling author is a gifted storyteller and popular speaker. But he sacrifices science for sensationalism, and his work is riddled with errors.   Current Affairs\n\n  \n\nThis book is a superficial gloss on human history. Nice try but it excludes too much subject matter in favor of an overarching conceptual view to be deeply interesting. Stopped reading for reasons detailed below at p. 304 of 416.\n\nConsidering the outlandishness of some of its claims the downside of the Agricultural Revolution, the joys of Empire the book seems weirdly under-sourced. The bibliography is beyond meagre. Don't get me wrong, I like a little informed speculation as much as anyone. Take for example the claim that houses, their advent, \"became the psychological hallmark of a much more self-centered creature.\" (p. 99) I, for one, would be delighted to know how one can discern the psychology of someone who lived more than 9,000 years ago. The apparently relevant note cited is \"2 Robert B. Marks, \". But when one looks up Mr. Marks' book one sees that it pertains only to the 15th to the 21st centuries CE.\n\nAnother thing, the book seems all biological determinism and we know what that sort of thinking led to: the Konzentrationslager. The life of the mind is nothing here, the intellect nothing, all because it has no discernible basis in biology so reductive and materialist, too. I'm hoping this is just a rhetorical device. Please, let it be. Moreover, the author cherishes a certain sneering and glib tone which I find annoying. Well, yes, now he's changing his tune, isn't he? But not before thoroughly pissing me off. Was that necessary? Ah, now he's starting to celebrate the very social constructs the law, the state, joint stock corporations, etc. that he so glibly belittled as \"imaginary myths\" a few pages back. So his earlier arguments were disingenuous. That's not something I prize in a writer.\n\nNotwithstanding the questionable attempt to raise the reader's hackles, just mentioned, I find myself on p. 170 and 95% of this is material I already know. Granted, the author tries to package it as felicitously as possible, but it's still stuff I know and, no doubt, material my well read GR friends will also know. What I had hoped for on cracking this formidable spine was something far more intellectually challenging, like . Still, I find myself nursing a hope that this is just an overly long introduction to a thrilling thesis. At the same time I fear it will turn out to be another tedious read for a far less learned general reader than myself. Am I overqualified for this book? Trepidation abounds. 2.0 stars so far, inauspicious.\n\nMeh. It's really an undergraduate survey course, if that. It's a great review of common knowledge that seeks to find new linkages and epiphanies. It sometimes works. But often the linkages are specious. As when he terms liberal humanism a religion. It isn't, though it's a neat shorthand for his minimalist theories. Now I'm reading about how religions are unifiers. The author certainly has a flair for the obvious, I'll say that much. Here's an example of author Harari's reductiveness, which is inevitable in a book skirting so many vast subjects. On p. 232 we read: \"The Aryan race therefore had the potential to turn man into superman.\" Nietzsche is nowhere mentioned. The statement is wholly lacking in context the Nazis are glossed but that's all. It really doesn't make coherent sense. Gloss, that's the word that best describes this book. A gloss.\n\nThe writer is careless with metaphors. We're told that cultures are \"mental parasites,\" that \"history disregards the happiness of individuals\" and that \"history made its most momentous choice.\" (p. 243-244). To say such things is to give agency to the non-sentient and adds to the narrative's by now utterly grating superficiality. Here's yet another bizarro statement:\n\n\nNonsense. The Spaniards had guns, germs and steel. Reread and , Mr. Harari. Foreknowledge would have availed the indigenous peoples little or nothing. The author goes on to admit as much in the paragraphs to follow, but why then wasn't that earlier sentence cut? But it gets better:\n\n\n\nIt's astonishing the author should use that ecclesiastical word. For what was the ostensible motivation of the conquerors but the glory of Christendom. Harari is blaming the victims. The world view of the Aztecs and Incas and others was limited. Harari blames them because they had not yet advanced beyond that basic if incomplete awareness. He then goes on to excoriate all of Asia and Africa for not having had the wherewithal to explore the world and conquer others. But these are cultural predilections, not standardized goals applicable to all. This leads to an unseemly West is the Best argument that's right out of Niall Ferguson's .\n\nIs this book popular because it essentially functions as the West's cheering section? It's lovely we have developed science and technology and historiography etc. I'm glad I live in the West. But it's absurd to say that earlier cultures, because they did not develop in a timely manner our own particular brand of curiosity, were deficient. All cultures are blood soaked, our own included. The world is only what it is, not some counter-factual supposition.\nShow more",

            "content": "I see many people complaining about the wild leaps of logic and the lack of footnotes - but honestly, what did you expect in a 500 page book, not even with small print, that's supposed to give you a summary of all history from the emergence of Homo sapiens to the present day? Personally, I thought the basic idea was terrific: the author has taken it upon himself to defend the Book of Genesis and show you that it's all true. I have seen creationists attempt the same thing and fail miserably, with their pseudo-scientific explanations of why the Earth is actually six thousand years old, how the Flood explains geology, etc. None of this nonsense for clever Dr Harari. He doesn't bother arguing about the places where science has obviously got it right (the Big Bang, plate tectonics, evolution), but takes them as givens. He doesn't get into the tangled reasoning about where a Creator might come into the picture; here, there is none.\n\nInstead, he cuts to the chase and gives you a story that's actually very interesting. About ten thousand years ago, people largely stopped being hunter-gatherers and started being farmers. This is usually presented by modern commentators as a Good Thing. But in Genesis, it isn't: we are expelled from the Garden of Eden and forced to eke out a miserable existence tilling the unforgiving soil, and now we have to live with the consequences. We have had the presumption to eat the fruit of the Tree so that we may become as gods, knowing good and evil. Harari ingeniously defends the idea that this, more or less literally, is what happened. We became farmers, then we started developing better technology, then we constructed cities, and finally, very recently, we invented science. We have made the most of our position as lords of creation, driving many species extinct and turning a few others into efficient machines for producing meat. But none of this has made us happier. In fact, as the Bible says, it's made us more and more miserable. We're evolutionarily adapted for being hunter-gatherers, not software engineers or stock traders. We are on the verge of learning how to conquer death and make ourselves immortal: but even then, we won't be as happy as we were back in the Garden. We'll more likely find new and even worse ways to cut ourselves off from our true heritage.\n\nHarari takes the position that our great strength as a species, the thing that sets us apart from all other living beings, is our ability to make up stories about things that are only to be found in our imaginations, and then treat them as though they were real; by this process, they become real. As he points out, empires and religions and money don't actually exist, but now they rule our lives. He's particularly interesting on the subject of money. Again, I can see some readers who dislike what they call his cheerleading for modern Western society. I don't think Harari is a fan of the West, and the book is in my humble opinion not Eurocentric at all; for example, Harari seems to like Buddhism rather more than Christianity. He's just pointing out the indisputable fact that Western society has taken over the world, and he ascribes that, more than anything else, to the West's ability to make up a better story about money, which we call capitalism. If this is where you're coming from, talking about the power of myth to transform human existence, you don't go overboard with the footnotes. There are no footnotes in the Bible. You do your best to tell a great story, and you hope that it will transform our existence.\n\nI think Harari's done pretty well here in terms of achieving those goals. Kudos.\n\nShow more",

            "content": "Is there anything more dangerous than dissatisfied and irresponsible gods who don't know what they want?\n\nWhat a fantastic book. I can see why everyone from Bill Gates to Barack Obama was raving about it. It's an extremely compelling, accessible history - almost like a novelization - of humankind.\n\nI've read a few of these \"brief history of the world\" books, most notably A History of the World in 100 Objects and Bryson's . I liked both, but neither is as engaging as this book. Also, Harari's book stays vague on the physics, dinosaurs and such, unlike Bryson's work, making this not so much about the whole universe, but specifically about humans. Or, I should clarify, .\n\nMost of all, I like how easy to digest the author makes all this information. I have a lot of respect for authors who can present something complex in simple terms. I've always liked the quote attributed to Einstein  If You Can t Explain it to a Six Year Old, You Don t Understand it Yourself . Anyone with a thesaurus can make something seem more dense and complicated than it is; it's much harder to explain something long and complicated in a way that everyone can enjoy.\n\n. Harari takes us through the history of human development and migration, through the Cognitive Revolution\nand Agricultural Revolution. He looks at how currency and coinage developed, the creation of religions, the arrival of imperialism and capitalism, and the history of inequalities and injustices.\n\nI especially like how he presents a relatively unbiased view of events. He focuses on what we know, and is quick to say when something remains a mystery to biologists and anthropologists. When there are conflicting theories, he outlines all the main ones. The only agenda Hariri seems driven by is a desire to present the most accurate view of humanity's history.\n\nThis book filled me with a sense of wonder. Wonder at how far we've come in just a few millennia; wonder at all the twisting roads of history; wonder at where we could possibly end up. The final chapters of the book take a peek at the future's possibility, making me even more excited (and a little scared) to read .\n\n| | | |\nShow more",

Prepare your tomatoes and raw eggs (someone actually threw a raw egg at me once for fun but it bounced from my bum  )\n\nSapiens  beginning was fantastic. I loved the author s voice and the information about the early days of the human kind was fascinating. I did not read any non-fiction about the origin of humans so I was excited to understand our origins better. I could not stop highlighting interesting passages to include in my review or to read later. Here are some of the ones that picked my interest.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, everything started to go downhill from somewhere in the middle of Part II. From an eager and excited reader I slowly became pissed off, disappointed and struggled to finish. I had several problems that plagued my reading experience and I plan to exemplify them below.\n\nFirst of all, I soon grew tired of the author s ironic and condescending humor. His ego was transpiring from all his words and his personal opinions and the way he tried to enforce them annoyed me more and more.\n\nSecondly, I felt like many of his assumptions and extrapolations had no proof and they only represent the author s personal opinion. For example, the way he supported for the whole book that humans were better of as hunter-gathers without bringing no real arguments to support his opinion.\n\nFinally, I had a problem with the scope of Sapiens. As the titles suggests, the book tries to be A Brief History of Humankind. I believe he did not succeed very well to do that and the reason is that it is quite impossible to do what the author planned in less than 500 pages. The task is too vast. The result is mix of everything with no structure, jumping from one subject to another and confusing the reader. The information was too vague, too general, it all resembled a set of interesting trivia.\n\nWhen reading other negative reviews of Sapiens I stumbled repeatedly on a recommendation: Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. The book was already on my TBR so it is going to be the next read on the subject. I hope it will be better.\nShow more",

I kept reading, . . . until it got so bad, I found myself unable to do more than skim, and eventually, to just skipping large chunks.\n\nIt starts out as a fascinating discussion of the development and rise of our species, homo sapiens. But starting in the second section on the Agricultural Revolution, Harari shift gears and drops any pretense of an scholarly work. From that point on, it s all personal bias all the time. This guy absolutely hates human beings and society. It seems that he is completely stuck in the idea that the world would have been better off had humanity simply stayed put in the hunter-gatherer stage.It seems all the countless billions of humans who lived since then are deluded and don't get it, and that only he understands. Yeah, right!\n\nOK. There are worse sins than personal bias. Many great writers have it and let it show. But unlike Harari, the good ones work to try to justify the positions they take. Harari, on the other hand just bombards readers with one opinion after another and treats them as proven fact, even though what he says is often debatable or out and out wrong. That s one of the reasons I gave up on a close reading as I progressed into the second half. Even when it seemed as if Harari was selling me something I didn t know (which did not occur often), I simply did not trust him. An author can choose to forego many things. Credibility and trust are not among them.\n\nPerhaps the best way to illustrate this mess is through a conversation I once had among people who liked to discuss philosophy. Somehow or other, though, this conversation veered off into a set of irritating rants on how western society sucks. The thing that sticks out most in my memory is how the host went off on a diatribe about the greatness of nature and Native Americans and about how he was fine being a non-vegetarian because the cows understood human need for meat and were happy to offer themselves as a precious spiritual gift to humanity. My reply:  That conclusion is based on interviews with how many cows?  The conversation abruptly ended. That is exactly the way I reacted to the self-serving gibberish offered by Harari under the guise of scholarly presentation.\nShow more",

            "content": "History and Sociology for Dummies, this book is almost irrecoverably watered down intellectually. [and for all those commenters that think I am calling them dummies, I am simply referring to the popular XXX For Dummies books and I am not intentionally insulting folks that enjoyed the book.] Sapiens does make some interesting points and probably opens a few debates, but it disappointed me. There are lots of soundbites here, especially the oft-quoted one about the agricultural revolution being \"history's greatest ripoff\", but they remain soundbites because they never really reach a conclusion.\n\nThe book starts out alright was the hunter-gatherer civilizations are discussed in some detail and without focusing exclusively on North America, Europe, and the Middle East. Harari's chapters here did make for decent reading about the concept the author calls the cognitive revolution which separates us from other animals. Unfortunately, the next section about the agricultural revolution is a bit too polemical. Yes, it was a radical change and yes it did lead to new problems (disease, famine, etc), but without it, the human species would likely have never evolved to the point of me typing this text on my laptop and you reading it in a browser. There are not parallel paths proposed, just a vague condemnation of agriculture before he takes on the subject of religions. Here, he talks of the evolution of monotheism from the polytheistic systems that abounded before. I felt he did not discuss in sufficient death the animist systems (which still dominate Africa, South America, and the Arctic among others.) He seems to favor Buddhism (the pages there have a much more tolerant and fawning tone than those of the other religions) which seemed a little intellectually dishonest to me - I mean if he is trying to develop a dispassionate argument about how religions develop, he should not take a particular position without announcing it first. Anyway, after this, the book covers the industrial revolution and brings us up to modern times.\n\nHonestly, I felt that the end of the book really soured the whole product for me. Well, I was already annoyed with all the cute phrases and the prolific use of \"!\" at the end of 20% of the sentences (OK, I am exaggerating but seriously, a \"history\" book shouldn't use the exclamation point says the snob reviewer). But when the author sets up an argument about where we should be headed as a human race, he then goes off on bizarre tangents about cyber technology and refers to an obscure Project Gilgamesh (which unless I missed something major earlier in the book, he never mentioned before). I felt that the last chapter just came out of nowhere and made absolutely no sense. Perhaps, as other reviews here on GR have suspected, no one actually reads this book, preferring to leave it unsullied on their coffee table as a prop to their showoff intellectualism. In any case, it didn't do it for me.\nUnfortunately, my in-laws who bought me Sapiens also bought me the sequel so I suppose I will be guilted into reading it at some point. In conclusion, I prefer reading REAL history books with caffeine rather than this decaffeinated, saccharin substitute for them. I would highly suggest the more factual and far less polemical which deals with a similar topic, but without the excessive punctuation (!).\n\nI am not alone in my disdain for this over-publicized waste of trees. A friend passed me this article: in which the author concludes:\n\"But Sapiens provides us with no resources for answering questions about the moral implications of scientific and technological change. A commitment to a reductionist, mechanistic view of Homo sapiens may give us some insight into some of the aspects of our past most tied to our material nature. But Harari s view of culture and of ethical norms as fundamentally fictional makes impossible any coherent moral framework for thinking about and shaping our future. And it asks us to pretend that we are not what we know ourselves to be   thinking and feeling subjects, moral agents with free will, and social beings whose culture builds upon the facts of the physical world but is not limited to them.\"\nThis book is waaaaay overrated.\n\nAs an aside, I wanted to briefly talk compare and with this book. In the , the author bemoans the wanton destruction caused by the agricultural revolution, but to my mind proposes no alternative and just leaves the reader with empty, vacuous soundbites. In the former two books, we are given a vast insight into how trees communicate and how they are intimately related to human beings. Yes, our ignorance of their speech (as alien to us as would be expected because our life spans and perception of time is on the same magnitude as that of flies to humans) has caused irreparable damage to the ecosystem. And there is an obvious domino effect: global warming and climate change. But, in the two books about trees, even if a militant outlook is shown to be a dead-end, it is demonstrated that being custodians of nature, we can help forests come back and preserve our biodiversity. It is not all of humankind that is to blame, as Harari would have us believe, but rather, rapacious grift driving large corporations which reap a direct, short-term financial benefit from wholesale environmental destruction. If the law was enforced rather than trampled upon, the jobs could be converted to conservation-related jobs and the forests could be preserved. I found that this positive message was stronger than any of the superficial aphorisms in Harari's book.\nShow more",

We usually pick the one we enjoy the most - and that's fiction most of the time - and stick with it for good. But every now and then, there is that book - which isn't fiction - but it feels better than fiction. And then among those select few, there is that book, once read, one cannot help but recommend to others regardless of their favorite genre. Sapiens is one of those exceptional books. This book, I belive, is an excellent read, irrespective of what your usual favorite genre is.\n\n\"As far as we know, only Sapiens can talk about entire kinds of entities that they have never seen, touched or smelled.\"\n\nThis is kind of a history book, but it isn't the typical history book, intended to a niche of readers. The way the author narrates is quite fascinating, and unlike in the typcial non-fiction book, gives the reader the craving to finish it in one go. And the way everything's organized is well thought out the the flow is perfect. Once started, though the book is somewhat long, you will not feel tempted to skip over any parts of it.\n\n\"You could never convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising him limitless bananas after death in monkey heaven.\"\n\nWe start off with a brief introduction to how everything in the universe came to be around 13.5 billion years ago, and quickly navigate to around 70,000 years from present, where things escallate. Then comes the Cognitive Revolution, then through agricultural revolution to modern era.\n\n\"historical record makes Homo sapiens look like an ecological serial killer.\"\n\"We did not domesticate wheat. It domesticated us.\"\n\nThe way how the social structures and various religions evolved was described in a very unique way. Typcially, we'd expect the author to explain along a particular school of thought, and explain reasons for accepting it to be the most reasonable way to look at things. But here, things are quite different. We are provided with different, and often contradicting, views on certain major historical aspect, while allowing us form our own opinions, which is kind of fun. And the subtle humor you encounter everywhere complements the flow nicely.\n\n\" A wealthy man in ancien Egypy would never have dreamed of solving a relationship crisis by taking his wife on holiday to Babylon. Instead, he might have built for her the sumptuous tomb she had always wanted.\"\n\nBut I guess this book is not for the history experts, for they might find things to be too simple. A connosiur of history might find the contents boring. However, for all others, this book has the ability to shift the way you look at the world quite profoundly.\n\n\" 'Cooperation' sounds very altruistic, but is not always voluntary and seldom egalitarian.\"\n\nYou can't afford to miss reading this book. You shouldn't miss reading this book. You must read this book. This just became one of my all time favorites.

She was educated primarily by her father and older brothers as well as through her own reading. The steadfast support of her family was critical to her development as a professional writer. Her artistic apprenticeship lasted from her teenage years until she was about 35 years old. During this period, she experimented with various literary forms, including the epistolary novel which she tried then abandoned, and wrote and extensively revised three major novels and began a fourth. From 1811 until 1816, with the release of (1811), (1813), (1814) and (1815), she achieved success as a published writer. She wrote two additional novels, and , both published posthumously in 1818, and began a third, which was eventually titled , but died before completing it.\nAusten's works critique the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century realism. Her plots, though fundamentally comic, highlight the dependence of women on marriage to secure social standing and economic security. Her work brought her little personal fame and only a few positive reviews during her lifetime, but the publication in 1869 of her nephew's introduced her to a wider public, and by the 1940s she had become widely accepted in academia as a great English writer. The second half of the 20th century saw a proliferation of Austen scholarship and the emergence of a Janeite fan culture."

To quote Austen herself from Sense and Sensibility:  if a book is well written, I always find it too short,  explains perfectly how I feel about this book; no wonder she called this  my own darling child,  for, for me, P&P is perfect in every conceivable way. It s the kind of book, the moment you finished reading, you are tempted to start over again immediately. However, reviewing this is another matter  I m excited, enraptured, but at the same time agitated, knowing that it s impossible to do justice to the author nor to the book.\n\n\n\nDuring my first reading of Pride and Prejudice, I had known I was hugely underqualified to review this book, though at the same time I had hoped, if I read all of her books, I might, in time, write an acceptable review for this masterpiece. Now that I ve read them all, and also P&P for a second time, all I can say is I still don t consider myself remotely qualified to write an objective review. But it is impossible not share one s opinions after reading this: this book, for me, is as best as it could get. So, for the time being, I ll have to be content with writing what I consider to be a subjective overview, which, I m certain, does not do much justice. However, I hope that someday my sense in classical literature would become good enough to truly appreciate how remarkable this book is.\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting with the plot, which has been thoroughly analyzed, criticized, and commented upon by thousands of readers, is surprisingly, at a glance, not that original, especially if you see this as a pure romance novel. True, there are many complications resulting from multiple relationships (or marriages), but overall, there are many similarities. But what makes this special is Austen s narrative: the sly humor, witty observations, unique lens through which she views the society, and the deeper understanding of morals of characters, are all perfectly concocted using her flawless writing style. And then there s Elizabeth; aside from inheriting traits like humor and wit from Austen, she is lively, curious, confident, but without becoming  too perfect  (like some of the Austen s other protagonists). She is as delightful as it could get. Rest of the characters are also similarly entertaining, with each one infused with a myriad of qualities to keep the story interesting. I don t think there was a single poorly written character in this book, and that s the first time I ve ever said that about a book. And I don t wish a single thing had turned out differently in this story. With the exception of some of the children s books, that s also a first for me. Sometimes it s hard to imagine, that this has been written over 200 years ago, or this ever becoming dated. Unlike with most romance novels, you will not see the reasoning, or common sense become lost in the middle of the story, which I think will help maintain that timelessness.\n\n\n\nThis second reading of the book only strengthened above opinions from my first read. If anything, everything felt even clearer, making the reading experience further satisfying. The only minor exception came with Lydia s plotline. Compared to my opinion from the first reading, where I had been a bit angry with her, that emotion has been somewhat shifted a little towards sympathy this time. Obviously, same couldn t be said about Wickham though. I also felt like that every single word here is essential during this second read. Although I didn t skip a single word during the first time, I believe I enjoyed each sentence a lot more this time.\n\n\n\nUntil now (that is till I finish my second read), I ve never watched any of the TV or movie adaptations of Pride and Prejudice. To be honest, I didn t want to have any negative impact towards the perfect imaginary picture Austen had created. But after this second read, I decided to watch the 2005 movie, the 1995 TV series and the 1980 series, and couldn t resist sharing some of my thoughts. As much as I appreciate the effort, the 2005 movie did not prove to be a worthy portrayal, at least for me. Maybe it s the modern characters, or what had to be removed due to time restrictions, or deviations from original book, but at the end of the day, I cannot say I loved it that much. But the 1995 series was quite the surprise! It literally had almost every single dialog from the book, with a few exceptions at the end. It did add up to five and a half hours of play time, but that was totally worth it. If you loved the book, and haven t watched the series, do watch it immediately. As for the 1980 series, though I loved it a lot, it fell a tiny bit behind the 1995 series. But both those series are commendable portrayals.\n\n\n\n\nAs for this review, I m going to label this as a work in progress, which I m hoping to update after each re-read.\n\n\nShow more",

            "content": "6.0 stars. Confession...this book gave me an earth-shattering Janeaustegasm and I am feeling a bit spent and vulnerable at the moment, so please bear with me. You see, I decided I wanted to get more literated by reading the \"classicals\" in between my steady flow of science fiction, mystery and horror. The question was where to begin.\n\nAfter sherlocking through my Easton Press collection, I started by pulling out my Dickens and reading which I thought was jaw-dropping AMAZO and left me feeling warm, satisfied and content. It also made me made retrospectively pleased that I named my youngest daughter .\n\nAfter Two City  Tale ing, I decided to give this book a whirl as I kept seeing it on GR lists of \"goodest books ever.\" However, I must admit I was hesitant going in to this for two big reasons. One, I thought it might be a bit too romantical for me. The second, and much more distressing, reason was that was on many of the same lists as this book. Austen fans should pull a nutty over that one.\n\nSo needless to say I went into this thinking I might hate it. Well, for the 999,987th time in my life (at least according to my wife s records)...I was wrong!!! I absolutely loved this book and had a mammoth, raging heart-on for it from the opening scene at the breakfast table when Father Witty (Mr. Bennet) is giving sly sarcasm to Mrs. Mommie Put Upon. I literaphorically could not get enough of this story. I was instantly captivated by the characters and Elizabeth Bennet, the main protagonist, immediately became one of my all time favorite characters. Mr. Darcy joined that party as soon as he showed up in the narrative as I thought he was terrific as well.\n\nOverall, the writing could not have been better. It was descriptive, lush and brilliant. The story could not have been more engaging or intelligent and the characters could not have been more magnificentastic. Elizabeth and Fitz are both smart, witty, self-confident and good. Austen could not have written them better. Oh, and I am sorry if this is a bit of a minor spoiler but I need to add that George Wickham is a cock-blocking braggadouche of startling proportions. I needed to say that and now I feel better.\n\nThis one has made it onto my list of novels and is truly one of the classics that lives up to its billing. ...Guys, do not fear the Austen...embrace the Austen...HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!!\nShow more",

            "content": "\"Pride and Prejudice\" by Jane Austen started off annoying me and ended up enchanting me. Up until about page one hundred I found this book vexing, frivolous and down right tedious. I now count myself as a convert to the Austen cult.\n\nI must confess I have been known to express an antipathy for anything written or set before 1900. I just cannot get down with corsets, outdoor plumbing and buggy rides. Whenever someone dips a quill into an inkwell my eyes glaze over. This is a shortcoming I readily own up to but have no desire to correct. So I admit to not starting this book with the highest of hopes. I did really enjoy Ang Lee's \"Sense and Sensibility\" however and so when my friend threw the gauntlet down I dutifully picked it up.\n\nBoy did I hate him at first. To get anywhere with this book one has to immerse oneself in the realities of life and marriage in the nineteenth century. At first all this talk of entailment and manners just left me cold. I liked the language to be sure. Austen's dialogue is delightful through out but dialogue alone (no matter how delicious) does not a great novel make.\n\nA hundred pages or so in though I started to see what a shrewd eye for character this Austen woman had. Mr. Collins was the first person I marvelled at. His character springs forth fully formed as a total but somehow loveable ass. From that point on I found much to love about this book. I was so into it by the end that I was laughing at some characters, sympathizing with others and clucking my tongue at an unhappy few. In short I was completely absorbed.\n\nIn conclusion I must now count myself a fan of Miss Austen's novels (and not just their fim adaptations) and do so look forward to acqauinting myself with more of her work in the future. \"Emma\" anyone?\nShow more",

In all honesty, I barely remember this book. So, negative comments regarding my intelligence are no longer necessary. They will be ignored. As they have been for probably 7 years now. CARRY ON!\n\nP.S. Can we all just LOL at my use of the words \"mind-numbing balls\"?? HA.\n\nThis book is quite possibly the most insipid novel I have ever read in my life. Why this book is so highly treasured by society is beyond me. It is 345 pages of nothing. The characters are like wispy shadows of something that could be interesting, the language that could be beautiful ends up becoming difficult to decipher and lead me more than once to skip over entire paragraphs because I became tired of having to stumble through them only to emerge unsatisfied, and the plot is non-existent, as though Austen one day decided she wanted to write a novel and began without having any idea what would happen except that there would be a boy and a girl who seemingly didn t like each other but in the end got married. The story really probably could have been told in about 8 pages, but Austen makes us slog through 345 pages of mind-numbing balls and dinner-parties. I don t care what anyone says, this is not great literature. This is a snore.\n\nShow more",

Does time always flow forward? Is the universe unending or are there boundaries? Are there other dimensions in space? What will happen when it all ends?\n\nTold in language we all can understand, A Brief History of Time plunges into the exotic realms of black holes and quarks, of antimatter and  arrows of time,  of the big bang and a bigger God where the possibilities are wondrous and unexpected. With exciting images and profound imagination, Stephen Hawking brings us closer to the ultimate secrets at the very heart of creation.",

        "bio": "Stephen William Hawking was born on 8 January 1942 in Oxford, England. His parents' house was in north London, but during the second world war Oxford was considered a safer place to have babies. When he was eight, his family moved to St Albans, a town about 20 miles north of London. At eleven Stephen went to St Albans School, and then on to University College, Oxford, his father's old college. Stephen wanted to do Mathematics, although his father would have preferred medicine. Mathematics was not available at University College, so he did Physics instead. After three years and not very much work he was awarded a first class honours degree in Natural Science.\n\nStephen then went on to Cambridge to do research in Cosmology, there being no-one working in that area in Oxford at the time. His supervisor was Denis Sciama, although he had hoped to get Fred Hoyle who was working in Cambridge. After gaining his Ph.D. he became first a Research Fellow, and later on a Professorial Fellow at Gonville and Caius College. After leaving the Institute of Astronomy in 1973 Stephen came to the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, and since 1979 has held the post of Lucasian Professor of Mathematics. The chair was founded in 1663 with money left in the will of the Reverend Henry Lucas, who had been the Member of Parliament for the University. It was first held by Isaac Barrow, and then in 1669 by Isaac Newton.\n\nStephen Hawking worked on the basic laws which govern the universe. With Roger Penrose he showed that Einstein's General Theory of Relativity implied space and time would have a beginning in the Big Bang and an end in black holes. These results indicated it was necessary to unify General Relativity with Quantum Theory, the other great Scientific development of the first half of the 20th Century. One consequence of such a unification that he discovered was that black holes should not be completely black, but should emit radiation and eventually evaporate and disappear. Another conjecture is that the universe has no edge or boundary in imaginary time. This would imply that the way the universe began was completely determined by the laws of science.\n\nHis many publications include The Large Scale Structure of Spacetime with G.F.R. Ellis, General Relativity: An Einstein Centenary Survey, with W. Israel, and 300 Years of Gravity, with W. Israel. Stephen Hawking has three popular books published; his best seller A Brief History of Time, Black Holes and Baby Universes and Other Essays and most recently in 2001, The Universe in a Nutshell.\n\nProfessor Hawking received twelve honorary degrees, was awarded the CBE in 1982, and was made a Companion of Honour in 1989. He was the recipient of many awards, medals and prizes and is a Fellow of The Royal Society and a Member of the US National Academy of Sciences."

            "content": "It is not clear to me who is in the target audience for this book. At times it tries to explain basic concepts of modern physics in simple language, and at other times it assumes a familiarity with the same subject. For the first time I think I \"understand\" why absolute time is not consistent with relativity theory or that space-time curvature supplants the notion of gravity, and for that I thank the author. There are a few other things I believe I have a glimpse of having (finally) slogged through the book.\nOn the other hand, there are many places where he writes as if it were clear what he is talking about even though it would require a good deal of background knowledge. To give but one example, he starts talking about summing up over possible world histories (I cannot locate the quotation) without explaining what that would mean. Trained in statistics, I have some idea that he is talking about mathematical expectation in the context of quantum mechanics, but I don't know how another reader might make any sense of it (and I certainly don't have more than a vague notion).\nThere are irritating writing practices that could have used some editing, e.g., the use of the naked pronominal adjective \"this\" when in the middle of a dense explanation of an abstruse concept(e.g., \"This had serious implications for the ultimate fate of massive stars.\").\nMy biggest complaints, however, are about his philosophical opinions. Obviously he is entitled to think as he wishes about the ultimate questions, but his assertion that his hypothesis of a finite world without beginning or end would leave no place for God seems beside the point. The classic divide has not changed: some folks look around and say stuff just is, and other folks say there's a power behind the stuff that has at least as much going for it as we do. That argument hasn't changed with his theories. At one point in the book he claims that the late John Paul II told gathered scientists that they mustn't inquire into the Big Bang because that was God's territory. I would wager with anyone reading this comment that such an assertion is just plain false. JPII was a flawed mortal, to be sure, but he was no dope; it certainly sounds to me like someone hearing what he thinks the pope would say. (And the Galileo jokes are pretty dumb -- does anyone think that JPII, who apologized for the embarrassing Galileo fiasco, would go after this guy? It must be all that influence the Vatican has had in Britain over the last 400 years that has him scared.)\nOther philosophical complaints involve his use of entropy (he defines it first within closed systems and then uses it to explain why the \"thermodynamic arrow of time\" and the \"personal arrow of time\" must run in the same direction -- leaping from a box of molecules to the entire universe!), his droning on about what black holes are like when he doesn't know for sure they exist, his statements about \"random\" and being 95% certain a theory is true (does that mean about 95 out of 100 theories like that are true??). His opinions may be very rich, deep, though-provoking, but how would I (or most general readers) know? You can't really evaluate a judgment unless you know something in the field.\nAnd so that is why I ultimately cannot recommend this book: if you know physics inside and out, you might find his opinions interesting. If you don't, you can only walk around parroting what he says about black holes as if you had a clue what you were talking about. What we all really need is a remedial course in physics!\nShow more",

It was first published in 1988. Hawking wrote the book for nonspecialist readers with no prior knowledge of scientific theories.\n\nIn A Brief History of Time, Stephen Hawking attempts to explain a range of subjects in cosmology, including the Big Bang, black holes and light cones, to the non-specialist reader.\n\nHis main goal is to give an overview of the subject, but he also attempts to explain some complex mathematics.\n\nIn the 1996 edition of the book and subsequent editions, Hawking discusses the possibility of time travel and wormholes and explores the possibility of having a Universe without a quantum singularity at the beginning of time.\n\n                  :                        1996      \n\n     :             :                                   :                      :                   :                         1369               231                        :        1369          : 1375         : 1378          : 1380            -964573519                                     -     20 \n\n                                                                                                    1993                                                                                                    \n\n                                                                                           (              )                             (            )                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n\n        : (                      -                 -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        :                                                                                            .                                                          :                                                   :                                                                                !                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                .               -             -                           .) \n\n                   18/07/1399              11/06/1400               .        \nShow more",

            "content": "Isn't it amazing that a person can read a book like A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking and come away feeling both smarter and dumber than before he started? What a universe we live in!\n\nIt's quite short and generally a quick read. Not every page is filled with mind-blowing/numbing theories and brain-busting equations. Some of it is just history, say on Newton and such. However, there were a few pages worth of passages where my wee brain felt like it was getting sucked into a black hole...mainly during the black hole segment.\n\nI've forgotten so much since I left school, and since school was such a long time ago, some of what was taught back then is now outdated, it was nice to read this refresher/cleanser.\n\nI came away with a better understanding of the Big Bang theory and why it's plausible (Not the tv show. Its existence is not plausible). I'm trying to sort out the time/space quantifiability thing. That's going to require a reread...and probably further study elsewhere.\n\nSurprisingly, I also came away with the idea that God and science can coexist. I didn't expect that. I figured someone like Hawking would be like, \"God? Pssh, whatever.\" But that's not his take at all, or at least that not the impression this book left me with.\n\nwas written with accessibility in mind, knowing full well idiots like me wouldn't buy it, read it or recommend it if it were impossibly dense. Hawking's sense of humor even comes through on occasion, which is always appreciated in these sciencey texty thingies. So, I'll probably move on to his next and I'd be quite willing to read others as well!\nShow more",

            "content": "Well, then.\nI know most of you think this is a book in which Stephen Hawking explains the history of what we think we know about space and time and the beginnings and end of the universe.\nYou're wrong.\nThis is a book in which Stephen Hawking shows people like me how poor our comprehension skills are.\nWHAT EVEN IS QUANTUM MECHANICS!?\nAnd more importantly, who these people who understand it!?\nGranted, I still use my fingers to count, so...\n\n\n\nYou know what surprised me most about this book?\nAs he was talking about Copernicus and Newton and Einstein and all of the theories they've come up with to describe how the universe works and how the earth spins and the stars burn, he never ONCE mentioned the Flat Earth theory as a viable thing. I mean, he kinda sorta flipped through it as a 'thing of the past' because of some 5th-century dude called Pythagoras thought there was something wonky about the moon being round if the earth wasn't round, too. It took a few hundred more years for Aristotle to put his name behind the idea and then apparently everyone just went with it.\nBut seriously.\n\nBecause I saw this YouTube video the other day that made a really good case for it. <--hosted by this guy called QAnon - sounded totally legit\n\n\n\nHe also talked a lot about the universe expanding and how that relates to (maybe) how the universe started. It seems as though common sense would say that if everything is moving away from each other, then if you were to hit rewind on your VCR you might be able to see it all contracting back together. At some point that contraction is just going to get smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and... <--then he brought up the quantum mechanics thing and just lost me.\nOk, to be fair, he lost me when he started talking about how we not be the center of the universe with everything revolving around the Earth.\n\n\n\nThe bottom line is that this is a love story about science and math and all the other things that I don't understand very well.\nBut fuck it, I'm trying!\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more",

On the surface the book has been written for the common man, for he who has little knowledge of theoretical physics.\n\nHawking uses basic terminology and he tries not to overload his writing with explanations and information dumps, but at times it is very clear that the reader needs a certain level of knowledge to understand what he's talking about. As such, Hawking makes certain assumptions as he shifts from concept to concept which left me a little confused. Things that don't appear related are related and it made me question who the intended readership was.\n\nI do believe this is a book every reader should try because it is an important one, full of discussions and ideas that could really open up your mind. But I would warn you to be prepared, although this seems like light reading, much of it may go over your head.\n\nShow more",

            "content": "Things I learnt from Stephen Hawking\n11 October 2014\n\nEver since I took up physics in year 11 I have had a love affair with the subject, which is odd since I went on to study an arts/law degree (but that probably had something to do with the fact that I would not have had the staying power to pour all of my energy into helping human knowledge advance towards establishing a unified theory). I still wonder where I ended up getting this book, and it had been sitting on my shelf for quite a while (probably because I was too busy listening to people tell me why I shouldn't read this book), but it wasn't until said that it was the most unfinished book (that is people start reading it but do not have the staying power to get to the end) ever written (I'm sure there are other books that beat this book though). There are quite a few things that I have discovered while reading this book, and it is these discoveries that I wish to share with you:\n\n\nOne of the impressions that I got from certain people was that this was a book that an atheist wrote to try to argue that God does not exist, in much the same way that does in his books. However, that statement could not be further from the truth. In fact, throughout the book the question of the existence of God perpetually hangs in the background. Granted, Hawkings does suggest that if the concept of a infinite bounded universe (don't ask) turns out to be true then it would undermine God's existence, however he does not actually say that this may be the case. In fact his final sentence in this book is that the reason we study physics and try to find a unified theory is because we, as a race, seek to understand the mind of God.\n\n\nThis probably goes without saying, especially since the cover of my book says that it is a 'record breaking best seller'. While he is involved in some very serious and complicated research he is able to write in a way that many of us who have probably studied physics up to a year twelve level (that is the end of High school) can understand. Okay, I probably have an advantage over most other people since my Dad is a theoretical physicist that we have regular conversations about some of these high level concepts (such as by having any more than three dimensions would cause the orbits of the planets to collapse), but I still found that he was very easy to follow and he explained many of these high level concepts in a way that many of us could understand.\n\n\nMany of us would be familiar with this guy:\n\n\n\nbut as it turns out, after reading this book, I have come to the conclusion that a lot of theoretical physicists seem to live in the same world that he does. Okay, they probably don't spend their time at the comic book store, or arguing whether Babylon Five is better than Star Trek (actually, one of my primary school friends is a theoretical physicist, and we did have such an argument), but they do seem to see the world in a way that we ordinary people would consider strange.\n\nFor instance, we see space as flat, meaning that if we look at a star, as far as we are concerned the star is in that direction. However physicists see space as being curved and that a straight line is not necessarily straight. We would see a brick wall as being a solid object and that the idea of walking through one would result in a sore nose. However physicists see it as being made up of mostly space, and the only reason we can't walk through it is because the nuclear forces (forces that exist inside an atom, not the force that can level an entire city) prevent us for doing so. Then there is the concept of dimensions: to us there are only three dimensions, however some scientists (and Hawking is not one of them) see that there are in fact ten, or even more, dimensions.\n\n\nWhile reading this book I could not get past about how complex this universe is and it made me wonder why it is, with the mathematical precision of the universe, and the complexity that lies therein, that so many scientists seem to argue that it all came about by chance. Even Hawking argues, using the second law of thermodynamics, that the universe cannot move from a state of disorder to a state of order   a broken plate simply cannot mend itself. However, the argument also goes that with the Big Bang Theory (not the television show) that the universe began in a state of disorder and moved to a state of order, however the laws of physics seem to suggest otherwise because what the big bang did was sent in motion a series of laws that caused the universe to come about to what we have at the moment. However, to go into details would require some intense theoretical physics, something which I have do desire to delve into at the moment.\n\n\nThe truth is that it is not. Okay, if light were travelling through a vacuum where there are no external forces acting upon it, then it is a constant, but that is very rarely the case. Take for instance this phenomena:\n\n\n\nThe reason light behaves thus is because when it hits the prism it SLOWS DOWN, and when it slows down it refracts. Thus my point is proven, the speed of light is only a constant when there are no external forces acting upon it.\n\nSo, what external forces may act upon light in space. Well, first of all there are black holes. When light hits a black hole the force of gravity is so strong that it will actually prevent light from escaping. Thus, gravity is a force that effects light and slows it down. Then there is the concept of , which are clouds of matter that do not emit light and float between the star systems. Okay, we know very little about the stuff (and it is also a theory, so it has not been proven) but my hypothesis is that if this stuff exists then would it not have an effect upon light, namely by slowing it down, which means that there is a possibility that our calculations as to the distance of stars from our own Sun could actually be wrong?\n\n\nOne of the things that Hawking stresses in this book is that theories are not actually proven. A theory is an idea that has some foundation based on mathematical calculations and empirical evidence. Therein lies the problem. Much of our understanding of the universe is based upon mathematical calculations, and it appears that if an event comes about which causes this mathematical calculation to break down, they immediately set out to try to find another mathematical equation to plug the hole.\n\nTake light for instance. For years we believed that light acted as a wave and suddenly it was discovered that it also behaves like a particle (a particle of light is called a photon). The same goes with matter   for years we believed that they were particles when all of the sudden we discovered that they can also behave like waves. As such, our understanding of the universe suddenly breaks down (meaning that we are not necessarily made up of atoms, but have wavelike properties as well).\n\nMathematical equations have been very destructive in out modern world. Take the Global Financial Crisis for instance. A bunch of apparently really smart people create complex mathematical equations to determine when to buy and sell shares and how to make billions of dollars. However what these equations did not take into account was the fact that people could not simply continue to accumulate debt without having to pay it back and when people began to default on their loans enmass, the whole concept broke down and we were taken to the brink of financial armageddon.\n\nAnother point goes back to Ancient Greece. Here we have the theory of Democritus, namely that matter was not infinitely indivisible (the smallest piece of matter is an atom), and then the theory of Aristotle, that is that matter is infinitely divisible. Scientists preferred Democritus' theory, however they soon discovered that you could break down the atom into protons and neutrons, and you could even break them down to quarks. So, maybe Aristotle was right after all.\n\n\nIt goes without saying that their research and discoveries have lead to the computer that I am writing this on, the energy that powers our devices, and the bombs that can level entire cities. We know how to make a nuclear bomb, as well as a smart phone, so we don't question what they say, because it obviously works. However, as a friend of mine once said, it is still all based on theory, and just because something works does not necessarily mean that the theory is correct. Remember that penicillin was discovered by blind chance.\n\n\nOkay, maybe the people that win these prizes are actually really smart, but then again, the guys who set up also won a Nobel prize, which proves my point.\n\n\nGravity is one of those odd forces that doesn't seem to connect with any of the other forces in our universe. As Hawking points out, there are four forces that have been identified: electro-magnetic, strong nuclear, weak nuclear, and gravity. Out of those four forces (five if you divide electric and magnetic, but since electricity will create a magnetic force, they are effectively combined) only gravity stands out. This is probably why Hawking spends so much time talking about black holes because black holes are where the gravitational pull is so strong that not even light can escape from its grasp. The other thing is that gravity does not, at least in our knowledge, have an opposing force. Gravity basically sucks, and that is all it does   it doesn't repulse as the other forces can.\n\nIt is interesting that in some texts that I have read (maybe it is speculative science-fiction but I simply cannot remember off the top of my head) some people have suggested that gravity is actually a force from another universe that affects our universe and what it is effectively doing is sucking our universe into their universe. However, as I have said, that is incredibly speculative, and since I am not a theoretical physicist I can't really say any more on the subject.\n\n\nThe idea of the God of the Gaps is that where there are gaps in our knowledge we simply say 'oh, God did that' and think nothing more of it. This goes back to the days of paganism (and Medieval Europe) where all of the unknown forces, such as the weather, was attributed God (or the gods) and we could not know anything beyond that fact. However I am arguing that it is a cop out. Creation scientists who resort to this argument are at best lazy and at worst dangerous. The reason I say that is that it discourages research into areas that we do not understand. Okay, we may never be able to control the weather, or predict earthquakes, but that does not mean that we should throw our hands up in the air and say 'this is too hard'.\n\nWhile I may be taking a swipe at creation scientists here, I would also take a swipe at the atheists who claim that there is no God. The reason I say that is because there seems to be a fear within the scientific community that suggests that we may not be able to know everything, or that our understanding of the universe may be wrong. The problem that arises is that if we throw the idea of God out of the window and claim that the universe came about by chance, then we deny the fact that we live in an incredibly ordered universe that we can learn and understand through the development of mathematical formulae. If a formulae turns out to be wrong, that does not mean that the universe will collapse in on itself   it won't   it just means that we have to go back to the drawing board and start over from scratch.\n\n\nWhy is it that some members of the scientific community insist that we must take the Bible literally? The Bible is not a scientific text, and it was never meant to be a scientific text. It is a theological text that tells us how we should live with one another and how we should view God. Science exists beyond the Bible, and neither contradicts the other. Okay, granted, God has intervened in this world and done things that break the laws of science, but doesn't he have a right to do that   he created the universe? However, what the Bible tells us is that God is a god of order, and if he is a god of order then does it not make sense that the universe that he created is an ordered universe?\n\nSo, maybe you are looking for a whiz bang conclusion to my exposition on this book, but all I can say is that what I have written above pretty much sums up what I have learnt from this book. In a nutshell (hey, this is me in a nutshell), all I can say is that what I have learnt from this book is that the world is an amazingly ordered place in which we live, and having now completed this book I am just as committed to my Christian faith as I ever was. However, if theoretical physics fascinates you, then this is certainly a book that you should give a read (though you have probably done that already).\n\nThis review also appears on my .

The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.\n\nSixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weight survival against humanity and life against love.",

For preschool viewers, she penned multiple stories for the Emmy-nominated Little Bear and Oswald. She also co-wrote the critically acclaimed Rankin/Bass Christmas special, Santa, Baby! Most recently she was the Head Writer for Scholastic Entertainment s Clifford s Puppy Days.\n\nWhile working on a Kids WB show called Generation O! she met children s author James Proimos, who talked her into giving children s books a try.\n\nThinking one day about Alice in Wonderland, she was struck by how pastoral the setting must seem to kids who, like her own, lived in urban surroundings. In New York City, you re much more likely to fall down a manhole than a rabbit hole and, if you do, you re not going to find a tea party. What you might find...? Well, that s the story of Gregor the Overlander, the first book in her five-part series, The Underland Chronicles. Suzanne also has a rhyming picture book illustrated by Mike Lester entitled When Charlie McButton Lost Power.\n\nShe currently lives in Connecticut with her family and a pair of feral kittens they adopted from their backyard.\n\nThe books she is most successful for in teenage eyes are The Hunger Games, Catching Fire and Mockingjay.

In a YA book.\nTwo reasons why this book rocks: (a) It is not Twilight, and (b) I really hate reality shows.\n\n\nSeriously, how long would it take for reality shows to evolve from \"Survivor\" to \"Hunger Games\"?\n\nYes, this book is full of imperfections. It often requires a strenuous suspension of disbelief. It can cause a painful amount of eye-rolling and shaking fist at the book pages. Its style is choppy and the first-person present tense gets annoying. The story is simple, and the message is heavy-handed. And here is an obligatory taken out of contest Twilight-bashing quote:\nBecause Katniss is cool and a badass. She is fierce, independent, resourceful, intelligent, and skilled. She is loyal to her friends and family. She is a survivor. She skewers that apple in the pig's mouth with an arrow in front of the Gamemakers in the most awesome way imaginable. For all that, I this imperfect, surly, prickly, sullen and perpetually pissed-off, quick to jump to judgment, and sometimes clueless girl.\n\n\n\nAnd I love this book because - despite being YA literature that seems to hinge on the romantic puppy love - the happiness of Katniss does not revolve solely around a cute male lead. Yes, there is a (hated) love triangle here *eyeroll* (*)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, here is what bugged me about the romance that DID make it into the book.\n\nKatniss and Peeta could have had plenty of other reasons to care for each other that don't include puppy love - they are from the same district, same school, he gave her that bread, she trades with his dad, etc. But alas, that did not happen. I understand that Collins had to cater to the way that YA publishers and Hollywood tend to view us, the female audience. But poor Peeta - all of his actions are colored by him being \"Lover Boy\", and I think it detracts from his personality and reduces him from a kind compassionate person to a fool in love who'd do anything for Katniss only because of his physical attraction to her. Yeah...\n\n...Rue...Oh, Rue...\n\n\nNow, back to the GOOD. Rue, my favorite character. Little, fragile, almost-too-perfect Rue who was clearly doomed from the start. Whose\nbrought the human side to Katniss (who, until that point, was almost bordering on robotic). There was real grief and anger and sadness in that scene, and from that point on I began to care.\n\nSuzanne Collins strictly follows the rule. (Actually, she does it to such an extent that the book reads almost like a screenplay.) The plot moves along at a fast pace, only slowing down a bit in the drawn out Capitol makeover and cave makeout sessions. Collins does not shy away from gruesome scenes, making many parts of the book hit home.\n----------\nI enjoyed it despite the imperfections. Katniss easily beats the majority of the popular YA heroines. And because of all her coolness, this gets .\n-----------------------------------------\n\nSo I saw the movie today. All I have to say - Suzanne Collins may have given life to Katniss, but Jennifer Lawrence definitely gave her heart. Lawrence's Katniss has such emotional depth, and she brings such truthfulness to her character. Excellent adaptation with a great balance of tugging on the heartstrings and darkness.\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more",

            "content": "Dystopian Perfection.\n\nIn a post-apocalyptic future, life has turned extremely hard. Fighting poverty and hunger every day, sixteen years old hunter Katniss does absolutely everything in her power to have enough for her defenseless little sister, and a barely lucid mother. Life is hard, yet not impossible, until the one fateful day arrives. Once every year, the ever vigilant all powerful Capitol of Panem celebrates for their entertainment the  Hunger Games , a yearly tournament where a handful representatives of each district are forced to fight in a massive arena, to the death. In a sad turn of events, young Katniss will have to fight not only for herself, but for the future of her starving family.\n\nI think this series needs as much introduction as Lord of the Rings; but what the hey, old habits die hard. Maybe not everyone has read it, maybe not everyone has watched it, but doubt anyone has never heard of it at some point. One of the greatest dystopian fiction of all time, or at least one of the best-selling ones. A literature masterpiece? Hardly. One of the most entertaining ever? Quite possibly! Astounding world building and character development. Not a profound reading at all, but a plot perfectly balanced, fast paced and action packed; if you can withstand YA that is, and the triangle thingy. Along with Percy Jackson and Divergent, one of the pillar series that sparked my literary addiction. Highly Recommendable.\n\n*** Hunger Games (2012) is a superb adaptation, maybe as good as the book, if not better. Highly popcorn and re-watch worthy. I don t normally reread, or feel the desire to; but lost count of how many times I ve watched the movie on TV. It just never gets old, and is perfect, for what it is; really bringing the characters alive in a way a book never can, and few adaptations ever succeed. Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson just marvelous in their roles, with an unforgettably heartbreaking performance by Amandla Stenberg as Rue too. Still, even a decade later I can never forget that Madge Undersee was left out of the adaptation; and the Tessera system hardly explained or mentioned; along with a few other minor things cut out. Not one of the greatest films but one of the greatest adaptations ever, hands down. One of those few cases where I think I ultimately prefer the movie rather than the book. Extremely Recommendable.\n\nTeam Peeta btw.\n\nAlso. Fatniss I m scared! <3\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n:\n[2008] [374p] [Dystopia] [YA] [4.5] [Highly Recommendable]\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n      [4.5]\n     \n      [3.5]\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nEn un futuro post apocal ptico, la vida se ha vuelto extremadamente dura. Luchando contra la pobreza y el hambre cada d a, la cazadora Katniss de diecis is a os hace todo lo humanamente posible en su poder para tener lo suficiente para su indefensa peque a hermana, y una apenas l cida madre. La vida es dif cil, pero no imposible, hasta que un d a llega el fat dico d a. Una vez cada a o, el siempre vigilante y todo poderoso Capitolio de Panem celebra para su entretenimiento los  Juegos del Hambre , un evento anual en una masiva arena donde un pu ado de representantes de cada distrito son forzados a lugar, hasta la muerte. En un triste giro de eventos, la joven Katniss deber  luchar no s lo por s  misma, sino por el futuro de su hambrienta familia.\n\nCreo que esta serie necesita tanta introducci n como El Se or de los Anillos; pero qu  demonios, los viejos h bitos nunca descansan. Tal vez no todos lo hayan le do, tal vez no todos lo hayan visto, pero dudo que nadie no haya escuchado hablarlo en alg n momento. Una de las m s grandes ficciones dist picas de toda la historia, o al menos de las que mejor vendieron  Una obra maestra literaria? Dif cilmente  Una de las m s entretenidas jam s? Muy probablemente. Incre ble construcci n de mundo y desarrollo de personajes. No una lectura muy profunda en absoluto, pero con una trama perfectamente balanceada, r pida en el ritmo y cargada de acci n; si pod s soportar lo Joven Adulto claro, y el coso ese del tri ngulo. Junto con Percy Jackson y Divergente, una de las series pilares que encendieron mi adicci n literaria. Altamente Recomendable.\n\n*** Los Juegos del Hambre (2012) es una sobresaliente adaptaci n, tal vez tan buena como el libro, sino mejor. Altamente digna de palomitas y volver a ver una y otra vez. Normalmente nunca releo, ni siento el deseo; pero perd  la cuenta de cu ntas veces he visto la pel cula por TV. Nunca se gasta, y es perfecta, para lo que es; realmente trayendo a la vida a los personajes de una forma que un libro nunca puede, y pocas adaptaciones llegan a lograr. Jennifer Lawrence y Josh Hutcherson absolutamente maravillosos en sus roles, con una inolvidablemente desgarradora actuaci n de Amandla Stenberg como Rue tambi n. Igual, incluso una d cada despu s no puedo olvidar que cortaron a Madge Undersee fuera la trama; y el sistema de las Teselas apenas explicado o mencionado; entre otras peque as cosas que quedaron fuera. No una de las mejores pel culas pero s  una de las mejores adaptaciones jam s, sin duda. Uno de esos casos donde creo que en  ltima instancia prefiero la pel cula sobre el libro. Extremadamente Recomendable.\n\nEquipo Peeta por cierto.\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n:\n[2008] [374p] [Distop a] [Joven Adulto] [4.5] [Altamente Recomendable]\n-----------------------------------------------\nShow more",

To clarify, I watched the second part of the last Hunger Games movie without having read any of the books, without having watched any of the movies.\n\nNeedless to say, I was confused as fuck.\n\nSo many questions and thoughts ran through my mind as I watched the movie. Why is Peeta so thin? Did that huge-ass bruise really disappear from her neck the next day? Is Katniss to look like she's about to burst into tears at any given moment, or is that just Jennifer Lawrence? Woody Harrelson is in this movie? Hey, it's Margaery from Game of Thrones! Who's President Snow? What's a Mockingjay? Lesser Hemsworth is pretty hot.\n\nWell, you get the point. I know how the book ended and I still have no idea who anyone is, and neither do I know their names, with the exception of Peeta, Gale, President Snow, that Coin woman, and Katniss. Of course, knowing how the book ended means I probably should read the first book, so\n\nAnd it was good. It was really good. My sister was right (she usually is).\n\nWhat else can I say that hasn't already been said? I loved it. The world building was interesting (although it helps that I've seen what it looks like on the big screen), and Katniss is . One of the things my sister didn't like about the first movie is that the on-screen Katniss was different from her portrayal in the first book. I haven't watched that movie, but I kind of see how the screen portrayal of Katniss might have bothered her. Book-Katniss is strong, kick-ass without being a Mary Sue. She has a fierce love for her sister, and she is manipulative and cunning. She uses the prospect of romance to protect herself, she has no qualms about using people, and I love that about her.\n\nTime to watch Movie #1!\nShow more",

            "content": "Hello, I am back again with another breakdown review while I relearn how to write reviews. But basically the TL;DR of this review is that truly holds up so well in 2020, and this reread was such a treat. I felt such nostalgia, happiness, and hope between these pages, and I already can t wait to revisit this story again. Also, again, this review will have , so use caution if you don t want me to tell you what happens in each chapter of this book!\n\n\n\n\nThis first chapter really starts off with a heartbreaking bang. We quickly learn so many characters, but we even more quickly learn what type of character Katniss Everdeen is. The basic premise of this tale is that there are twelve districts and once a year each district will select two young candidates to fight to the death in a game, which will also be broadcasted for the world to see. Every year, a teenagers name gets added once to this random selection pool, but each year they get older another time their name gets added. Also, you can add your name more times to get food and supplies for your family, and this is very much the norm for most children. Katniss s sister, Prim, only has her name in the drawing once because it is her first time, where Katniss has her name added over twenty times. Yet, you see where this is going \n\n\nOnce Prim s name is pulled, Katniss immediately volunteers to take her place in the games. Meanwhile, the boy contestant is Peeta Mellark, who Katniss remembers giving her bread when her family was starving after the death of their father. Together, they are thrown into a competition that no one believes they will be able to come back alive. Especially since only one victor is allowed, therefore one of them will most certainly have to die.\n\n\nKatniss is given her iconic mockingjay pin that will literally change the world as she knows it.\n\n\nHaymitch punches Peeta to make him look rougher, lol. The journey Haymitch is about to take alongside these two kids as their mentor, whew.\n\n\nCinna (my favorite character), makes Katniss a fire dress in which the world has never seen, and will be the first time the world finds it extremely hard to forget her or her name. Also, unknown to Katniss, a start of a public romance is brewing with Peeta to help their image. We also get to meet President Snow and start to get a vibe of all the evil things he has been stirring up for some time now.\n\n\nKatniss and Peeta make it to the training center and they start to learn about the other candidates from the other districts. We also get to learn about the different privileges of the other districts, and how some of these candidates view this as an honor to volunteer their life for (without needing to save a little sister). We also get to see Rue, and it s really hard to not feel like you want to reach into the pages and protect her yourself.\n\n\nKatniss makes quite the impression with an arrow and an apple, that many important people of the Capitol find very hard to ignore.\n\n\nThis is the start of the Peeta versus Gale debate, and the brewing of a very opinionated love-triangle. For me, personally, I always think it s obvious in Katniss s inner monologue that she only likes Peeta, but I digress.\n\n\nWe get to meet Caesar Flickerman and see Katniss and Peeta s vastly different interviews with him. Peeta is coached to very much play the star-crossed lovers card, and he even tells Caesar that he loves Katniss more than anything.\n\n\nThis is the start of Part 2, where they games are finally going to begin. And Cinna says my favorite line in the entire series to Katniss. So simple, so beautiful, so heartbreaking.\n\n\n\n\nThe twenty-four tributes are entering the game, and in the middle is a cornucopia filled with weapons and supplies  if you are brave enough to make a run for them. Peeta distracts her at the very start of the game, so Katniss doesn t go for the bow. And we quickly see that people are starting to form groups to take out some of the weaker players.\n\n\nKatniss is proving that she will do whatever it takes to survive.\n\n\nKatniss is still up in a tree, surviving, when she sees Rue and they form a silent plan together.\n\n\nShe does get the medicine she needs from someone out there watching her in the world, who is rooting for her and her life. After with the help of some killer, engineered wasps  she is able to get down from this tree and gets a bow.\n\n\nKatniss teams up with Rue, while they come up with a big plan to make it a little harder for the districts teaming up with all the supplies.\n\n\nYeah, Katniss blows up the whole cornucopia.\n\n\nYet, while Katniss and Rue are trying to meet up again with their mockingjay signals, Rue gets killed by a spear. Katniss sings to her, and realizes that nothing will be the same in her life again, no matter how long she has left.\n\n\nKatniss is trying to deal with the hurt and pain and loss as best as she can, but she also is very hard of hearing in one of her ears now. And she also knows that Peeta has been wounded and is missing.\n\n\nBut beyond all else, Katniss is a tracker and a hunter, and she quickly looks for Peeta at a water source and finds him. They also share a kiss when they find shelter, and she vows that she is not going to let him die.\n\n\nThis chapter has some beautiful foreshadowing of giving Peeta some berries.\n\n\nBasically, at this point, each contestant needs a certain supply very badly, so they place the things they need back in the middle of the map, and Katniss goes to retrieve theirs. She does get very injured in the process but makes it back to heal him. Thresh helped Katniss because of what she did for Rue.\n\n\nPeeta takes care of Katniss and they get more care-packages because they are now the Capitol s OTP and everyone is rooting for them and their romance.\n\n\nThresh dies, and it breaks my heart every time because I highkey always root for him too. District 11 just deserved better. Cato is still alive, still the biggest threat, and still hella annoying. And then we have some more berry foreshadowing when a girl dies eating some.\n\n\nNow that there are only three people left (Katniss, Peeta, and Cato) the game makers want them to finally put an end to the 74th Hunger Games once and for all. Kato runs at them, while wolves start running after them.\n\n\nAnd we quickly find out that the wolves are none other than the people who died in the games. Well, I think at least. They for sure have the tributes eyes, and it just makes it extra freaky. But basically, after some fighting and some monologues, Kato is dying to the wolves slowly, but Katniss puts him out of his misery. They were promised earlier that if Katniss and Peeta were the final two of the game that they could both win and live, but now the game makers are trying to change that game right before them. And since they are saying there can only be one victor, Katniss takes a risk with those beloved berries and her an Peeta threaten suicide before all the people watching from the comfort of their own homes.\n\n\nBut because they need a winner, they decide two is better than none, so they both are able to live. Katniss wakes up in a hospital where her body is healing and she is able to hear out of her one ear again. She gets to see Cinna, and believe that maybe their lives will be normal again. But Katniss quickly realizes that the Capitol is terribly upset that she played with them, and they are not going to ignore her actions in the game.\n\n\nKatniss gets to see Peeta again, and they are forced to watch all the deaths that happened in the game during their winner s interview. They both have taken so much damage physically and mentally, and they know that Snow is not through hurting them, or the people they love, by a longshot.\n\n| | | | |\n\nfor loss of a parent, animal death(s), abandonment, depression, PTSD depiction, blood depiction, alcoholism, gore, violence, and murder.\n\nBuddy read with & !  \nShow more",

            "content": "A lot of things are troubling me about The Hunger Games. A lot of things which I more and more perceive and which are not solely connected with this book but with the metaphor behind the words. People attach themselves to fictional freedom without seeing what really something is and which unfortunately is here to stay because you can't wake a person who is pretending to be asleep. You can t make a shift on a deeper level, if the only thing that attracts you to this book is   a vision of fight, retaliation and the outcome of freedom. Freedom of flesh.\n\nIn comparison to the freedom of and from your mind which is nowhere to be found.\n\nAnd this is why I detest this book, although detest is such a strong from the ego word. Because the whole purpose of this story is to show how people shouldn t sacrifice their children for the better of their communities and with the positive outcomes realise that we are so much stronger and yada yada.\n\nTHE WHOLE PURPOSE of this book should be that there shouldn t even be in the first place a need to sacrifice members of our society for some other people to be amused. And where after the battle of ''united'' people we heal and repair the damages for the better tomorrow. The society cancer of western civilisation thinking.\n\nHeal the damage, never heal the cause of it.\n\nBut then we wouldn t be talking here about the same book. We would be discussing how humanity can help each other with being better, with taking responsibility and with being open to each other.\n\nAnd yet imagine this paradox we live in: better, as if the majority of population can even understand that we are in constant blood thirst to achieve peace. With war comes peace. While along the way we are trying to be better and safer. Yet most people deliberately choose to live on the utmost lowest level of their existence. In fear, frightened of itself.\n\nAnd people read books which are so extreme in their bullshit. And people connect with Katniss because she is the heroine. She has managed to outsmart the system. Instead of thinking that she was not even supposed be there in the first place. Because we live in society that does this to their children.\n\n''No, we don t!''\n\n''We do...''\n\n''But children can learn how to fight.''\n\n''You teach them to fight for individual puppeteers. And instead of working on yourself, how to achieve your inner peace, you associate yourself again with the group because it feels better to be in the tortured crowd, instead of being alone and awakened.''\n\n''What are you talking about? It is just emo gibberish. Leave Katniss alone. And in the end, it is just a book. Why don t you want people to read and educate themselves, does everything have to be deep and meaningful, can t you just relax?''\n\nYes, everything has to be deep and meaningful since we are drowning in shit of meaningless and shallow. The system as it is, the plot of this book is just another evidence to show us how we are controlled. That we are left barren from our true selves which we only find in empathy, love towards each other and genuinely understanding that we are one and everything is one. But on this provincial&marginal&primitive&emotional level, so many took this book for granted.\n\nAnd the only reason I am writing this review here, the only reason I am giving it so much attention is to tell what is on my mind since it is so widely popular and since I have read it. And one of the main reasons why I can t really keep things light and popsy is because so many things are already deep down in gutter light and popsy and mainstream. As if having money is any critieria for life, as if not having your own free will and education and information means nothing. And the other side of the rich coin is poverty with people who believe in symbols, who are sidetracked with religions, censured TV, economy and utter lack of information circulation.\n\nAnd a lot of people here are trying to disregard this review and want to reassure me that I am so terribly wrong. BUT, you have yet not seen what I am talking about and it is perfectly OK.\n\nSo I followed as well screaming Goodreads recommendations and I bought a book that is stupid, violent and written so plainly but of course written for vast masses so they can be touched by fake social awareness. Because it is fake, but most of all it s tragic.\n\nAnd this is not a critique toward Collins, in my nature of a thinker and seeing her a person who shared her thoughts and which millions of people loved and connected with, I am still a firm believer that the general public just didn t understand what she was talking about. And this is my silver lining. Because it has been like this throughout centuries and with the biggest thinkers of our civilisation. What they meant and wanted to show, is definitely not what most of the public projected.\n\nBecause the mainstream public is a group of sheep, not seeing anything properly, but following and like a Tarzan, screaming, don t you dare stealing my Jane from me. As a metaphor, don t you dare telling me these uplifting emotions are not true, when all in me about this book tells me that is correct and how people should live their lives.\n\nAnd if the mainstream likes it, uh, then definitely that is not what it s true.\n\nIt is just a constant reminder how so many things are left unrecognised while these superficial stories which evoke cheap emotions are always so hugely praised. It could have been just a little story but never underestimate the obese octopus that is called In God And Country We Trust - code red mentality. Mentality of humans which are too ignorant, beautifully naive and untouched basically with what is means to be socially aware.\n\nAnd although this is a teen book, it is more deeply hurting and sickening because if you want to influence somebody, of course you will influence the children   and yet there is nothing that children can learn from it. They can learn some things, we all need little courageous Katniss, but on a deeper subtler level is it just an intravenous injection of more Nothing and more Numbing and more Disconnected.\n\nAt least they read is one of the arguments. And argument as fruitfull as at least they eat GMO food. One food for the blind intellect, other for the digestion which both results in basic survival without any interference of you in all of it. Because it takes courage and guts and a pinch of anarchy to stop, turn around and start questioning what is handed.\n\nFor me, the thought about giving this to a child is sickening especially because we live in this world where all the life criterias are upside down. Because a child will not learn how things are vile and disturbing because Katniss told them through her delusional and hyperventilating focus, but a child will learn about life s cruelty, and it will be touched by it sooner or later, by questioning everything that is served in front of it.\n\nBecause if it is served somebody is earning money and you are just getting fatter and sicker.\n\nAnd the children will learn how to question if you teach them how to find not if you broadcast them the answers. Not if you teach them through aggressive examples and if you keep the nation in cold sweat especially if you are lucky enough to live in the countries where oppression is not the issue but consumerism, body image and mediocrity have you on the leash.\n\nI am astonished with a fact that around 75.000 Goodreads members read this book and that around 50.000 of them rated it 5 stars. What is it that fascinates them so much.\n\nIt s disturbing because people obviously associate and find themselves in this book. And it's about a girl Katniss Everdeen, living in the far away future, who was chosen to participate in a cruel Big Brother game, in which 24 contestants (children age 12-18) kill each other, because live TV has become demanding, and the public loves reality blood and violence. That's it. A little bit of undeveloped and unbelievable romance between her and two boys, a little bit of her abandoned family problems, a little bit of The 5th element movie political structure, mutants and pop stylists. It s so screwed up.\n\nIn the beginning, first 50 pages were well written. There was suspense, Katniss was sweet and witty, but overall this book is a shitty meltdown. Adding the ridiculous cliffhanger ending. Some people here are using words like dystopian literature, and then write essays about how this book is the core of it.\n\nThe core is pointlessly graphic and sadistic, without any concrete message except of the negative: this book is just proving that the world today is fucked up if this book is so successful. I don t see the point of reading about the fictional kids who are doing this to each other.\n\nIn a metaphorical way it is promoting political establishments of certain countries and that is getting tiring. Not all people are eager to swallow the shit of general brainwashing. Katniss being the heroine (ironical quote marks). Being loyal and darling and a role model. Just wake up. Life is happening and some pretty dark things are happening while you are thinking that Katniss is the representative of the club called liberation.\n\nFor me, in a bookish way it stands for one bad one night stand, kiss and forget. But as always, readers tend to bring fiction to their real life and just as many think that kittens and superheroes are comfort zones, a lot of readers perceive this plot as their own little shrine.\n\nBut that is me not being in tune with the mainstream population which is too distracted with billboards.\n\nBecause it is easier, because why protest, why not simply take what you are given - eat your GMO Monsanto's company hamburgers, eat your cancer giving Nestle products and think that The Hunger Games are the best franchise ever, like ever. If you don't have any arguments about real life activism and if you think that there is deepness in this plot which I have yet not seen so you need to enlightened me, just include North Korea or Hitler or ISIS(L) or those poor people who are closed in Zara hangers who work nonstop ''somewhere'' in the world because obviously you are aware of the crisis although you don t think you could show on the map but you have heard somewhere on Murdoch media.\n\nThis shit sells. It's genuinely bad but excellently targeted. You know, it evokes pride and loyalty and massacring children, freedom and scandal and Hollywood. It goes very well with all the Kardashian filth. As long as it sells, sells, sells. And marketing agencies know that people are united when they are jealous, when they want and they with those hamburgers want freedom. Nobody is going to kill their Katniss in a goddam book! Really? Take a look around you.\n\nAnd then the punch line for this book comes from the so called activism from the shopping mall. People who devour literature of this kind and think that everything is all right while in the same time, fuck, you are getting oozingly fat.\n\nBottom line.\n\nThis book is very shallow and MTV culture oriented, like a classical example of easy consummated pop-literature; I'm very surprised that it didn't come with some trash magazine subscription. If it doesn't have savage brutality, prize money and prefix ''media coverage'' then it won't be appealing and educational because surely this is how children of 21st century survive this techno media world; through examples of true moral issues and realistic outcomes. Have another gulp of Coca-Cola along the way while you listen to dubstep shit.\n\nIt saddens me when a violent hillbillish book is so popular. What is there to truly identify yourself with. Except if your chicken soup for soul are basic emotions which come with buy 1 get 1 free.\nShow more",

            "content": "I read this when it was first published, ordering it before I knew it was YA, and years before any films (which I've not seen). If I were a teenager or recommending this to a teen, I might give it 3*; as an adult, I give it 2*.\n\nPLOT\n\nIt's a potentially exciting but gruesome story, but most of the characters were rather flat, and much of the plot was predictable, partly because it's not hugely original. See Shirley Jackson's , which I reviewed , and the Japanese . Furthermore, there were too many flaws in the plot. I fail to understand its very high ratings.\n\nPost-apocalyptic America (Panem) is divided into a wealthy and technologically advanced Capitol and twelve subsidiary districts of oppressed people who exist in dire poverty, with inadequate food, housing, and health care and hardly any technology. To reinforce the power of the Capitol by instilling fear in the population, once a year, two children from each region are selected by lots to fight to the death in a reality show. If that were not bad enough, the whole thing is utterly corrupt in multiple ways, plus the public bet on the outcome, and sponsors can sway the results. Did I mention these are ? (Some are as young as 12, though the narrator is 16.) A compulsory full-body wax on a teen seems rather pervy and who would want to bet on, let alone sponsor a child-killing tournament, even if it's by helping one of the contestants? As the book keeps reminding readers, one person's survival is only possible by the death of the others.\n\nCRUELTY TO CHILDREN\n\nI realise that horrendous things are done to children around the world every day (extreme poverty, child soldiers, sexual assault, genital mutilation etc), but in none of those cases is the that but one child dies, and nor is it organised by the for a sick combination of sport, entertainment, punishment and profit.\n\nHumans often lack compassion, but I was never convinced by Collins' world - especially the fact this outrage has continued for (it's the 74th games), apparently without the Capitol even needing to invoke gods or supernatural powers to justify their cruelty! Could a barbaric annual tournament really be such a powerful incentive not to rise up in all that time? (I don't think so.)\n\nBIG ISSUES\n\nNevertheless, it tackles some big themes that are particularly pertinent to teens: the nature of friendship; divided loyalties; the difference between love and friendship; who to trust; whether the ends justify the means; the need to repay favours; the danger of power, wealth and celebrity; the corrupting influence of reality TV; the need for independence, and whether you can trust a parent who abandons you.\n\nIt all feels rather laboured to me, but it might not if I were a teen, which only reinforces my puzzlement at the number of adults who have enjoyed it. I must be missing something.\n\nNARRATIVE STRUCTURE\n\nNearly half the book is backstory and preparation for the games; the remainder is a tale of hunter and hunted. I predicted the main plot twist less than a quarter of the way in (and the fact that Katniss is telling the story limits the possible outcomes), but the suspense was broken when it was made explicit way before the end. There are some other twists between then and the final page, but by then I was rather annoyed with the whole thing.\n\nIMPLAUSIBILITY AND INCONSISTENCIES\n\nI'd enjoyed the book more, I would have found it easier to suspend my disbelief, but as it was, I was constantly irked by questions and inconsistencies.\n\n* The contestants (and their parents and grandparents) have been forced to watch the games every year of their lives. I suppose they had become inured to it, but on the other hand, that meant they the horror of it. I just didn't believe there was as little fear in them as there appeared to be - given that they are children.\n* Participants don't want other participants to know where they are, yet sponsor gifts occasionally drop out of the sky, via silver parachute; not a risk, apparently.\n* It's all filmed by numerous invisible floating cameras (I can buy that), but that somehow includes filming inside a cave that is virtually sealed (I can't).\n* How (and why) would any of these participants be able to measure time to within half hour intervals?\n* How big is Panem? It can only be a tiny part of the USA because each district specialises in only one thing (coal mining, agriculture etc) and has just one town square that can accommodate everyone (8,000 people in District 12) and yet it's a day's train journey from District 12 to the Capitol. It doesn't seem like a very plausible settlement pattern in a post-disaster world, even given the totalitarian regime (concentrating people in a few centres makes it easier to observe and perhaps control them, but it also creates more opportunities for opposition movements to develop).\n\nCOMPARED WITH LORD OF THE FLIES\n\nThere are some similarities with \"Lord of the Flies\" (my review here: ), but although \"The Hunger Games\" is likely to have more appeal to modern teens, I think there are (at least) two crucial differences:\n\n* In LotF one person's survival is not necessarily at the cost of everyone else's. (It is even possible that they could all survive.)\n\n* LotF has much more depth and symbolism: it tackles original sin; the mystical \"Beast\"; leadership, tribal allegiance and group dynamics (including bullying and attitudes to difference and minor disability) and the importance of ritual and belief.\n\nThe second point is what makes LotF a better book, in my opinion.\n\nOf course, there are other, more obvious, parallels with extreme \"reality\" shows such as \"Survivor\" and \"I'm a Celebrity, get me out of here\", but the fundamental differences are not just that contestants in those shows do not fear for their lives, but that they are adults who have to enter.\n\nI TRIED TO ENJOY IT!\n\nAny fans who read this will now hate me. I wanted to enjoy this book, and I read it all the way through, making notes as usual, but to no avail. Sorry.\nShow more",

            "content": "For a long time now, I ve wanted to rewrite my review of The Hunger Games so that I could tell you why I don t just love this series, but why I also think it s important. It is beautiful for the unflinching way it shows you, as a reader, your own willingness to disregard people who are different from you - how you are the Capitol audience. But, it is important as a story about girls. I had not initially thought about articulating that point because it seemed so obvious to me, and I am bad at recognizing my own assumptions. Lately, though, I have seen so many people, both men and women, acting as though this remarkable book is a piece of fluff that I realized maybe what I love most about is not as obvious as it seems. To me, this series is important because it is a landmark departure from the traditional story about girls.\n\nToo often, stories objectify women. But the word  objectify,  I ve realized, has almost no meaning for someone who has either not experienced objectification or who hasn t really recognized it in her own life, so I m going to be more descriptive here. When I say stories objectify girls, I mean they that sometimes have handy dandy extra gadgets such as an and .\n\nSidebar: if you are inclined to now google the word \"fleshlight,\" I encourage you to consult the before doing that, as the google results will probably be NSFW and also NSF those of you whose parents might check your browsing history. Do parents know how to do that? Sorry for the sidebar, I am just intending to make an explicit point, and now I am feeling uncomfortable about what that explicit point might mean to the target audience of this book. Girls, you are probably badass like Katniss, and you are definitely a fleshlight.\n\nBack to my rant about typical objectification in storytelling: often the fleshlights have . Sometimes they have , and other times they work as for or or . A lot of times, I will hear people refer to this type of objectification as treating women like they are just a vagina, or a pair of boobs, but I think there is something to the stories that is less human and more sexbot machine than that complaint covers.\n\nSo, in all of those links, I have tried to include books written by men and by women because I think that women think of ourselves this way almost as often as men think of us this way. The link from , for example, shows both a man and a woman treating women like fleshlights. I have also included both books I love and books I hate because, ultimately, I do think girls adopt this story about themselves, and I also think we can pretty easily identify with a male protagonist and disregard female characters who look nothing like humans. For example, is one of my favorite books in the whole world, even though it does not contain any women who resonate with my experience of humans. And I don't think it's necessarily bad that I can enjoy stories where women are only fleshlights, as long as I can still be whoever I want to be without a positive role model. I think it's good to enjoy stories and take what we can get from them, and so I don't regret that I love .\n\nIn seeing some male reactions to , I am reminded that most men do not identify with female protagonists the way women have been trained to identify with male protagonists. This seems like a huge disadvantage for men to be in, to me, and if you are a man reading this review, I would ask you to check out your bookshelves. How many female authors are on your shelves? How many of the books those authors wrote have no central male character? If you have a minute after that, check the shelves of a woman you are friends with and see how many of her books were written by men or have no central female character. Odds are the results will be pretty different.\n\nis such a groundbreaking and deliberate example of a woman s perspective on war and family and even men that it floors me. I think it partly floors me because, other than , I can t think of another example of a female character who really fights for herself in such an obvious and hopeful way. Katniss is strong and broken, and powerful in her brokenness. Collins s image of a woman s perspective is not, admittedly, as effortless as Moira Young s in , but its deliberateness has its own value.\n\nIt is not an accident that the story shows Katniss s emotional growth and that Peeta, as a more emotionally whole person, facilitates her emotional growth. It is not an accident that the story does not discuss the effect Katniss has on the erectness of Peeta s and Gale s penises. The first is not an accident because in reality, men do not have to be the emotional cowards that the stories I ve linked to above make them out to be. Masculinity does not have to mean emotional cowardice. The second is not an accident because the story is not from Peeta and Gale s perspectives. Despite widespread rumors to the contrary, it is my experience that women pretty seldom think about their effect on men s penises. Hopefully, we think of our primary purpose in life, in the way so many stories think of it, as making penises erect. Hopefully, we never think of ourselves as gadgets that are super fun for other people.\n\nThere are so many reasons I love series, and all of this is one I wouldn t have initially even thought to say. I saw this Eleanor Roosevelt quote earlier this month, and it said,  It is better to light one small candle than to curse the darkness.  I think is a candle in the overall dark narrative of girls  perspective on life. Yes, it is also a poignant critique of reality TV and Western callousness about the catastrophes caused by industrialization in the developing world, but that, too, resonates with me in many ways because of its remarkably feminine voice. It absolutely makes sense to me that this book is not for everyone because of its violence, but I still think that it is objectively important because it shows a perspective that seems authentically feminine to me   that talks like a girl, not like a sexy, fancy gadget. I m not saying that in my opinion girls don t or shouldn t ever think about being sexy or erect penises, I m just saying that it is my experience that we think and care about many, many more things than penises, clean houses, and food, and very, very few stories are willing to tell you about that. The is one that does, and it does so in way that is beautiful and important.\nShow more",

            "content": "It seems weird that I never reviewed The Hunger Games . I don't know why I didn't when it was a series that completely took over my life for a short while. But recently I've been thinking about posting something in this review space and after just watching the second film (which I think was amazing and better than the first), now seems like as good a time as any to talk about why I love Katniss and nearly everything about this series.\n\nI gave this book four stars back in 2011 and I'm going to leave that rating as it is because it's an indicator of my thoughts at the time (though they slightly differ now) - thoughts which were influenced by having just finished the fantastic, horrifying, brutal and unforgettable manga series. I don't think it was the best time for myself and Katniss to find one another when I had so much beautiful insanity to compare the book to, but it still managed to have such an effect on me that I instantly told every friend and family member to read it. Coming back to this now after having spent the last couple of years being bombarded with dystopian YA, I appreciate what Collins has achieved a whole lot more.\n\nI appreciate the strength of Katniss as a heroine who commands our attention and holds our love whilst still being what some would consider unlikable; I appreciate the balance of beauty and horror that Collins delivers on every page, treating us constantly to both the darkest despair and rays of hope; and I also - amazingly - appreciate the love triangle. Love triangles seem to have chased me and hunted me down with every YA read I picked up over the last two or three years - my dislike for romance instantly becoming doubled by the introduction of yet another boy with beautiful eyes. But Katniss, Peeta and Gale worked for me. They convinced me, held my interest and made me cry. The love triangle worked because it's outcome wasn't obvious, because we all wondered and hoped and worried.\n\nKatniss still remains for me everything that a female protagonist should be. Or a female hero, at least. She fights for the ones she loves, she's brave and doesn't need to be saved. But neither is she a one-dimensional smiling poster-version of a heroine. She falls, she fails, people get hurt because of her and she has to live with that. We love her and yet she's antisocial, awkward and moody. She loves other people with all her heart but she's not much of a team player. In short: she's a complex portrait of a young woman that doesn't fall into any neatly defined boxes or categories. Now, perhaps, authors have since tried to recreate her. But she's still one of the first and best.\n\nI know another review of this book isn't needed. I know you've all probably read it anyway. Or never will. But this isn't really for anyone else; it's a reminder to myself of why this book deserves its hype and why I need to remember to come back to it again and again between the new (and hopefully amazing) YA books I'll be reading in the future.\nShow more",

I ve already seen the movie, but the book is so much better.\n\nIn The Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen is scraping by, just trying to make her daily living, hunting by her bow in the forest to feed her family. Every year, The Capitol requires every district to offer up one boy and one girl as tributes. The tributes fight each other to the death until only one person survives. This fight is called The Hunger Games.\n\nThe day of the Reaping finally comes. This is the day where the one boy and one girl are selected. Unfortunately, Prim, Katniss s younger sister is selected. In an incredible act of bravery, Katniss volunteers to take her sister s place. Will Katniss make it through The Hunger Games?\n\nFirst of all, the narrator on this was perfect. She even did the accent for the Capitol people, and she sang the song.\n\nSecond, The Hunger Games is a perfect dystopian novel. It has different dresses and customs, but it isn t overkill or confusing.\n\nThere are also many parallels to today s society. For example, why do the citizens allow The Hunger Games? Because they don t believe that their children will be selected. How many people believe that they will never be unemployed, never get divorced, never become seriously ill or injured? People like betting on themselves. But we, as a society, aren t we better off if we made sure that there were strong safety nets in place for those who happen on hard times?\n\nIn The Hunger Games, all is also not equal. The tributes can have sponsors who rain down much needed supplies on the tributes. We like to think that everyone has an equal opportunity. But is that really the case when the rich can purchase private ACT/SAT tutors for their children? What about those who start their first job and have strong allies and mentors from day one?\n\nBut I also loved this book, because it had many small acts of kindness.\n\n\n\nWith cruelty becoming commonplace, kindness stands out. When District 11 came together, I racked my brain trying to remember the last time that we, as a society, came together for a cause, and I came up short. I think the world is hungry for a rallying cry, a cause that we can all fight together for. What would the world be like if the cruelty was replaced by kindness? Full disclosure: may have cried just a little bit reading this.\n\nLooking forward to the next book in the series .\n\n- The Girl On Fire\n\n\nShow more",

Of course, I loved Peeta!How can I not? He is perfect!\n\n\nBut Katniss? Why?? She is so strong and bad-ass but she always misunderstands Peeta! It's so obvious that he loves her but she is in denial! She is so stupid!! And when she realizes his feelings, she just hurt him! Congrats!\n\n\n4 stars because of Katniss' stupidity!\n\n\nLet's start from the beginning!\n\nWhat is Hunger Games?\nEvery year, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 were selected from each of the twelve districts as tributes, who train for a week and then are sent into an arena to fight to the death.Only one tribute can win the games. This competition is showed to television to be seen by all citizens.\n\nSo, Katniss' little sister, Prim, is selected for the games, but Katniss took her place to save her.\n\nThe boy who was chosen to participate was Peeta Mellark, a boy who Katniss knew because she saved her from starvation and give her some bread as a result his mother beat him!\n\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n1) I loved Peeta! He protected her but I will admit she protected him as well! She risked her life to get the medicine needed to heal his leg. But how can she not see that he is madly in love with her? I loved it when he told her about her singing for the music class, that's when Peeta realized he was in love with her when he saw that the birds were listening like they did for her father.\n\n\n\n2)I think she has feelings for him deep down! Very deep.\n\nSometimes when she kissed Peeta she felt guilty because of Gale! Why????He is her best friend! At the beginning, she said that she never saw him that way and now what? She is confusing me.\nPlease, not love triangle again!!I liked Gale but no!\n\n\n3)Curiously, I liked Haymitch! He won the Hunger Games of his time. He is also Katniss' and Peeta's mentor. It seems at first that he doesn't like Katniss very much but at the Hunger Games he helped her more than he helped Peeta.\n\n\n\n4)I also liked Cinna, their stylist. He always supported her in his way.\n\n\n5)Rue! She was the 12-year-old female tribute from District 11. I really liked that Katniss allied with Rue. They were amazing together. But Rue died.\n\nI understand only one can win( our case two) but I felt so sad when she died. Not only her though. A lot innocent kids die because of the Capitol. It's not fair.\n\n\n6)In the half of the games, it was announced that two tributes from the same district can win. So katniss and Peeta can be allies. But when all the other tributes died it was announced that the rule they said early has been canceled. I was so angry! They did it on purpose. Assholes!!!\n\n\n7)When they announced it, Katniss aimed her bow at Peeta when she sees he has picked up a weapon, but he throw it into the lake. She is so stupid. He didn't want to fight her and she thought that he could kill her.\n\n\n8)I was scared when Peeta and Katniss threaten to commit double suicide so there will be no winner! But it was a trick. Thankfully, that trick worked and both PEETA AND KATNISS WERE WINNERS!\n\n\n9)And the ending! Peeta discovers that Katniss was mostly acting during the games about the feelings. He was so heartbroken! My baby!\n\n\n\nP.S. I haven't seen the movie yet!\nShow more",

            "content": "I LOVE THIS BOOK! I've said to a few people that if I wasn't married, I'd have to marry this book. :) I read the 400 page ARC in a less-than-24-hour time period (so quickly that it was never even on my \"currently reading\" shelf), which I've only done before with HP books, and I've just officially put the first book on my 2008 favorites shelf. I feel pretty safe in saying that if this isn't still my favorite book of the year when next January rolls around, that I'll eat a hat. As soon as I finished reading it, I turned around and read it a 2nd time, which I've never done before in my life. I loved all of Collins' GREGOR books, and think she's a wonderful writer, but she's ratcheted it up to another level with this one. Even though it's the first in a trilogy, this one definitely stands alone, and I'm not sure how she can keep it up for another 2 books, but I suppose it's possible (think: THE GIVER, although I loved GATHERING BLUE, and liked THE MESSENGER--HUNGER GAMES is much more brutal than THE GIVER, though). It's got some very meaty issues to chew on, not the least of which is reality TV taken to extremes. There's a chaste and unresolved romance (think: TWILIGHT, but I don't think I will make it past the first in that series--HUNGER GAMES has much more action, more of a plot, lots of well-developed secondary characters, as well as extremely likeable main characters. I will miss Katniss until I can read about her again.). What more could you possibly ask for out of a book? It doesn't actually come out until October 2008, but if you can get your hands on an ARC, definitely do! I think that the violence in this will be easier for kids to take, since they probably won't see it quite as clearly as an adult will. None of it is particularly graphic, but it is definitely brutal. This is on the edge of too dark for me, which is my favorite kind of book. There aren't many writers who can push it right to the edge for me without going over (Zusak comes to mind immediately), but Collins is definitely one of them. Another book that I loved, and think of to compare this to is HOUSE OF THE SCORPION, but that fell apart slightly at the end for me. HUNGER GAMES didn't lack anything at all for me. OK, I'll stop gushing. I may have to re-write this review when I get some perspective. (2012: Obviously, I never did rewrite it, and this is my most-\"liked\" review :)\n\nMy 10 1/2 yr old son asked to read this with me, so I read it for the 3rd time with him in Oct 2008. Still my definite favorite book of the year, but all the typos in the finished book were pretty disappointing. Still, it's my choice for just about any award out there, come January, including the JHUNT.\n\nUpdate May 2009: I am dying because the CATCHING FIRE ARC has just been released, and people are saying it's at least as good at HG. I've had 2 teenaged boys at my library read this on my recommendation, and both of them came back asking me for more books like it (really there isn't anything). One of them has pre-ordered CATCHING FIRE on Amazon (updated to say that I worked in a fairly disadvantaged neighborhood in DC at the time, so that was not a usual occurrence).\n\nMay-June 2011: I'm reading this for the 4th time, with my younger son, who's finishing up 5th grade. Still as good as ever!! Can't wait for the movie!!\n\nUpdate 2012: Between them, HG and CATCHING FIRE were the pinnacle of my 20-yr career as a YA librarian! I've seen the movie twice so far, and definitely liked it better the 2nd time, when it didn't have to try to be my favorite book. :)\n\nUpdate 2020: It's been 9 years since I last read this, but I've never listened to the audiobook, so I decided that having it read to me would be a good activity during the covid-19 pandemic. STILL as good as ever, and the odds will forever be in its favor.\nShow more",

            "content": "Fantastically Written? Ooooh yeah! Compelling? Yup! Super Quick Read? Most definitely! Original? Um...well *shuffles feet, since I seem to be a rare non-five star-er* not original at all really....\n\nMan, I wish someone on my friends list here has also read Battle Royale and this book! The Hunger Games WAS pretty fantastic, hence the four stars (though I would have given 3 1/2 if the choice was available.) I ate it up, shouting into other rooms and offices that I was going to be shoving the book into their hands as soon as I was done, but as it went on desha vu was a little too common for me. I know there are major story types out there, ones that are repeated over and over again. Shakespeare retold 200 different ways. The bible reinterpreted to 2,000,000 varieties of tales....but when it comes to YA dystopia, which is by far my favorite genre of any book, originality is one of my main ways I judge a book. FEED felt utterly original. The world of UGLIES felt new. LITTLE BROTHER was just plain amazing. If it's going to be about \"the future\" we don't know about, make it original. In my mind dystopia novels survive on \"idea\" more than \"excecution\" and while the execution of this was beautiful, the idea was hardly new.\n\nWhile I have a really good feeling Collins never read, or maybe even heard of, Battle Royale, The Hunger Games was 90% the plot of Battle Royal, minus the guns, the extra blood, the ability to get to know all the other players. In Battle Royal (short explanation of BR plot: 40 students put on island forced to kill each other and winner is set for life and put on TV etc...), the main focus is a love story between two students trapped in the game, two students bonding together with no real urge to kill others...one of whom had a crush on the other forever and it is only revealed during the game. There are so many other similarities, from the ways the gamemakers manipulate, to the ways the media encourages, to one character having a fever and the other taking care of them with soup. There are even \"career\" battle royal players. In BR you see the emotions before and after someone is killed, their last thoughts, the feeling of the person who killed. It's actually really beautiful the way it is done, and so believable that put in an arena teens WOULD turn into savages. In The Hunger Games, yes the main characters were fantastic, and many of the lesser as well, but Foxface is only Foxface, and the Careers are never more than random 1-dimensional bad guys.\n\nThe Hunger Games was very Battle Royale, very The Long Walk (Richard Bachman book), and very much current reality shows. I am not saying it wasn't a GREAT read, I'm just saying it shouldn't shake the publishing earth the way I am pretty sure it is going to. I anticipate this is the next Twilight series people are going to gush over. In a few years we'll all be hosting Hunger Games final book parties. I'll be amongst the attendees I'm sure.\n\nAlso in terms of female main characters, Katiniss may surpass Bella in me wanting to shake sense into a character. Talk about a smart girl being utterly clueless!\n\nYes, it was great, but eh, maybe I'm just bitter because I think BR is the better book of the two and while Hunger Games will get tons of praise and likely a rather deserved award or two, BR will continue to be banned in many libraries. Amazing what subtracting guns can do to a story. Suddenly it doesn't feel as violent, but rather is more reminiscent of stories we heard growing up. The number of swords and arrow deaths in traditional fairytales is nothing to freak out about, but if bullets are flying, it will give \"too many ideas\" to teens and therefore must be dubbed an adult book.\n\nI'm pretty sure if I hadn't read BR just a few months back this exeedingly long review would have been just as long only instead of a rant it would have just been one long squeeeeeal of delight over how much I loved the book.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Comment: Peer pressure, peer pressure, peer pressure. Geez guys! Alright, alright I'll read it!\nShow more",

            "content": "spoilers but do y all remember that scene in book two where all of the victors are being interviewed and keep saying shit that cuts right to the capitol s bone, all really purposefully overdramatic, and then right after Katniss gets up and that shit with the Dress happens (which she instantly knows is a life sacrifice one of her only friends is making for her) Peeta gets up on that stage and makes a normal speech and then ends it with  I d be fine, if it weren t for the baby  like when is literature ever going to reach those peaks of bad bitch energy ever again\n\nI think this series is so fascinating in that it basically spurred an entire genre of sort-of-okay YA dystopians and then a lot of really bad YA dystopians, and it gets put a lot into that category. but...\n\nThe love triangle being pointless is ; Gale and Peeta are meant to represent the opposite sides of war (something a certain plot point in book three really drives home). Katniss is frankly never romantically interested in either for almost of books one and two; she grows to care about Peeta in the general sense, not just the romantic sense. The eventual romance works for Katniss because it is for her.\n\n(What I m saying is this was tenderness.)\n\nI more think this series is interesting in how it talks about the nature of power and The uprising, as a whole, is an upswelling of the people, a realization that there is strength in numbers. Yet some of the most revolutionary actions of this series are individual   it takes Katniss  desire to save her sister to start a war, Katniss  love for little Rue to create horror, Cinna s willingness to sacrifice his life to create a symbol. Even during war, the individual lives of characters like Joanna and Haymitch and Finnick . They matter to the narrative, and thus they matter to us too.\n\n\n\nKatniss Everdeen is still a deeply revolutionary heroine not only in that she s written to be fairly gender non-conforming but also in that she is outwardly cold to all but her very few favorite people, and the narrative does not see fit to her for it, but to empathize with her and allow her to grow naturally in small ways. Her journey is not in becoming a Nice Person but in self-actualization. That is not a journey female characters are ever ever ever allowed to take and is arguably still something new.\n\nI almost want to case study this. It s a similar dynamic to Lord of the Rings being blamed for the general problems of late-1900s fantasy... but worse, because criticism of the YA dystopian genre so often fell into somewhat misogynistic areas, and I don t think there s any point in denying that , due to having an image as Something Young Women Enjoyed  , received far more criticism than its equivalents in other genres.\n\nIt's crazy that the first big ya dystopia is the best ya dystopia and one of the best series of all time, but this one is truly a classic and remains so incredible. Thank you to Katniss Everdeen for being one of the most interesting characters ever written and to this book for having such a dynamic story.\n\n| | | | | |\n\n\n     \n\n\n1. The parallels to our own society are so amazingly drawn, and the worldbuilding so good, that I'm not surprised this book was the one that broke through.\n2. Tell me you weren't on the edge of your seat every moment of this book. You're lying. Katniss' struggle to survive on her own is compelling and twisty. Every moment is filled with fear and tension.\n3. Katniss Everdeen is one of the best developed, most intriguing protagonists ever written. She's badass and she's selfish and she takes no shit. In the end, I think that's what made this series so fantastic and popular.\nShow more",

            "content": "My  The Hunger Games  week\n23rd march- movie is released\n24th march- I read this review and end up watching excellent trailers, Later I downloaded the excerpt and kind of liked the first chapter\n25th march- I am a proud owner of the book. Yay!\n26th to 27th march- I started reading the book\nThis is how I thought it would go:\nOnce I would start reading it, I would just be sucked into it and finish the book remaining awake until early hours of morning, with my bloodshot red eyes.\n\nI started it and was immediately sucked into the book but then around midway I started losing interest. I fell asleep and had horrible dream (credit to graphic violence). Next morning I finished it owning to its fast pace.\n\nThis is . I was very much excited about it since it was my introduction to a new genre. I would like to thank this book for such amazing description of dystopian world.\n\n\nThis is a kind of book which probably everyone has read including their dogs, cats and birds too!\nSo there is no need to hide the spoilers but as warning-\n\nThis book started brilliantly and within few pages sucked me into it. The . Introduction to districts, new society, people s life, the rules, the reaping, and yes  The hunger Games . It is fast paced with simplistic writing. These are all good things. The best part kids are starting to read the books.\nBut that s where the good things end.\nSuzanne Collins created the opportunity (golden ones) and one by one she destroyed it. But still most of the people are enthralled by the book as it eventually came out. But I m not.\nSo I m going to tell very explicitly what I didn t like...\n\n\nThis story has been told through the eyes of Katniss Everdeen, she just doesn't give a damn about anyone else except her family so naturally the other characters are too shallow and one dimensional.\nMany people just love Peeta and Katniss but I don t like either of them. was that he liked Katniss from age of five, saved her twice and is now in love with Katniss, rest is mystery.\n, she does a lot of thing (infact she does everything in the book) but never has a second thought about them, never reflect over what she has done, eventually no attachment with the character.\nbecause these are few characters that spent time with Katniss, but (again)no character has depth.\nOne more outcome that I feel from other reviews is that Katniss is definitely heroine of the story but why make other 10 kids villain. While Cato and Clove make their kill they become monster but when Katniss makes her kill, it has to be justified as revenge for killing Rue and pity killing of Cato.\nThis book is all about ...\n\n\nThe plot is so much predictable that I was surprised after every 10 or 20 pages (I m not out of my mind) because the story would turn out exactly how I would guess. First I thought that maybe my mind is highly synchronised with Collins s mind but later on reading other reviews it turned out the plot was predictable.\n\n\nThis could have been much more interesting novel. Where did it all go wrong? As I m writing, everything wrong in story to me looks like is outcome of first person perspective.\n--I would have felt much more connected to the games had it contained a bit of background information of every important tributes. Despite the killings being graphical, I didn t felt sad for their deaths.\n--, she moves over to do other things (because Rue is dying). But later when she realises that it was her first kill, still she doesn t reflect over it even for a minute. Killing other human has effect on the killer, until and unless killer is sociopath, moreover here the killers are kids. Instead of giving insight to their mind the story flatly moves ahead with killing and ending the games.\n\n\nI read books because I enjoy it and because they push my mind to a new level of thinking which benefit me. This book made me think only about, why I didn t like this book when whole world is enjoying this. No further thoughts beyond that.\n\nMaciek s thought on this book:\n\nFOR ALL THIS\nIn many reviews people come out with most lame excuse (defense) I have ever heard-\nAs for other books in the series, I will definitely read them but I m not in hurry or excited with this prospect. I will read it someday, probably before second installment of the movie.\n\n\n- I watched the movie\nturned out pretty good, much better than I had anticipated. As I watched the movie it seemed that novel was written with movie in mind. Few minor changes, like in the end President Snow shown thinking representing its start of story unlike novel which ends. Some scenes are breath taking, too much violence. Acting by Jennifer Lawrence is good (she turned out better than Katniss in the book). I liked the movie, rated it 7/10.\n\nThis review is inspired by and .\n\nShow more",

So maybe Matthew Fox from Lost isn't exactly the person you had in mind when you thought about who they might cast as Katniss in The Hunger Games, but I was inspired to create that after I saw You might want to wait to visit it, though, because it can suck you in like an unexplained time warp flash.\n\nI was also inspired to create the Jackniss after I read a discussion that deeply disturbed me.\n\nSomewhere, possibly on Goodreads, I read that someone thought the . What!?!? Forget the genius Suzanne Collins, let's give it to the guys who left the greatest mystery in all of TV history completely unexplained. Don't get me wrong. I love Lost and appreciate it greatly, but they really explained nothing in terms of the plot. But don't even get me started on that - Circuits overloading. Bzzzt. *sparks*\n\nBoth Lost and Hunger Games are great character stories, but Hunger Games plot. It cannot do without. That's obviously not going to happen since Suzanne has already written the script, but just play along for a second.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow,, I won't even try to justify why you should. You just should. This is just one of those books that someone says \"This book is AMAZING.\" Then, you take their word for it and read it.\n\nAnd seriously, WHY haven't you read it yet?\n\nThis is the kind of book that is so awesome in a completely thrilling and demented and emotional and shocking way that it makes you want to bang your head against the wall while throwing fairy dust in joy. Two things that I have done in the past, but before at the same time. That's how powerful this book is.\n\nAfter that, it makes you want to cry. Cry like a little baby. Like a little baby in it's crib. Then scream. Scream like a frikkin banshee with a frikkin laser beam on it's forehead.\n\nBefore I read this, I had a friend who told me that this book was 100 times better than Twilight. (I'd say that it's actually more like a gorgonzolazillion times better and don't ask me the exact amount that represents. Let's just call it \"To infinity and beyond.\") She also said that it was going to be an even bigger phenomenon than Twilight. I was like \"Hah!\" Let's face it, it can get ridiculous with the Fangirl mobbing and the crying. But I concur. I think this WILL be bigger than Twilight and obviously better. Maybe even Oscar worthy. I certainly hope so, anyway.\n\nI know that I said I wouldn't try and talk you into reading this book but I honestly can't help it. I'm not sure that I'm doing a great job at it, though. Let's try a little visual aid.\n\nHere is an artist's rendering of our heroine, Katniss Everdeen:\n\n\n\nAnd here's the gorgeous young lady who has been cast. Jennifer Lawrence.\n\n\n\nShe may not seem like the spitting image of the girl from the book, but there is such a thing as hair dye and dirt. And and there is Photoshop, of course. So here is a pic that someone made and posted online of Jennifer as Katniss. It may change your mind.\n\n\n\nAnd this side by side.\n\n\n\nAll right, besides the oversized cartoon eye, she is pretty damn close. Well, I'm convinced. How bout you?\n\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, :\n\n\nAlso, here's the artists version of Peeta, our hero.\n\n\n\nI know that a lot of people would disagree but, to me, guy is Peeta.\n\n\n\n\nAnd just so everyone knows - The Hunger Games is currently .\n\nDownload it .\n\nI'm not sure how long the sale will last, though. I already own the book but I am seriously considering buying the Kindle edition just for the hell of it.\nShow more",

            "content": "May the odds be ever in your favour\n\nPanem is a nation that lies in what used to be known as North America with a Capitol which is surrounded by 12 districts. To discourage rebellion the Capitol forces each district to send a tribute of one boy and one girl a year to participate in The Hunger Games. A deadly competition which is aired live on TV, and in the end there is only one victor, only one survivor.\n\n\n\nKatniss Everdeen, a sixteen year old girl from district 12, volunteers to take the place of her little sister in the games. Luckily Katniss is used to surviving under the harshest circumstances. But what Katniss doesn't realise is that being able to kill and hunt is not the only things that will help her stay alive but also forming friendships, alliances, and making sure the audience likes her.\n\n\nPicking up this book again had me transported to my younger THG obsessed self. I find myself thinking about the hunger games quite often. And how nothing I've read since 2012 has ever had such an impact on me.\n\nI will always admire Katniss's love for her sister. Her strength and unwillingness to give up. She's spent so long in survival mode that it's hard for her to have normal relationships with people and she constantly questions everyone's motives. I must say though that's probably what kept her alive in the arena.\n\n\n\n\n\nRereading this was a whole other experience. It's been almost 10 years since I first read these books, I noticed things I didn't before. Things that annoyed me then, are clearer to me now and I think I connected to the characters even more than I did back in my first read.\n\nThe writing is not very descriptive. It has little embellishments but I think it does a good job of reflecting Katniss's personality, who is a very straight forward and  no-nonsense  type of person.\n\nAnd while I'm not really a fan of books being told in the first person, I don't mind reading Katniss's POV. The writing is still very immersive and I think Collins did a good job of making the reader feel part of the story.\n\n\n\nThe fast pacing and action keeps you hooked. I can't even explain the on edge feeling you get while reading this. Even for me who has already read this book and watched the movie countless times.\n\nOver the years I've fallen out of love with dystopian books and in general I don't really like books set in the future. I know, I know what is wrong with me right?!\nMaybe it's because, , nothing really compares to THG.\n\nThe setting is so unique. I love how the bareness of district 12 is described compared to the ostentation of the Capitol.\n\nThe world of the hunger games is definitely not one I'd ever want to visit ; )\n\n\n\n\nI'll admit I became very emotional (are we even surprised by now) while rereading this. I think it's because I already know what's in-store for the characters.\n\nI found it immensely funny how suspicious she was of Peeta and his genuine kindness.\n\n\n\nAh, Peeta Mellark. Our sweet cinnamon roll. He's just so:         \nLiterally can't believe there are people out there shipping Katniss with Gale when we have our precious baker right here.\n\nThe part where be said :   had me crying like a baby. My love for Peeta Mellark knows no bounds.\n\nMaybe I didn't notice before because I was more concerned for Katniss but this time my heart really felt for Haymitch. Even when you win the games there's still no escaping them. And besides his own horrors he had to face in the games and other things the Capitol did to him, every year he had to watch as two more kids got killed, for which he most likely feels responsible. I never really gave much thought before to how he coped with all that.\n\nI love the movies and for a long time I believed that they were so great that it might not even be necessary to read the books as long as you've seen the movies (which are master pieces. in my opinion the best adaptations of all time) but during this reread I realised that there is an element to the books that could not be translated to screen. The movies are good companions to the books but could never replace them.\n\nIf you have not read I highly suggest you try them out. It's never too late! They are great to read no matter your age, but I think they're also really great for young teens who are starting to get into reading or even those who are reluctant readers. Personally these books opened up other world's to me and will always hold a prestigious spot on my shelves.\n\n\n\n\n___\nRereading this for the first time since i read it way back when!! i already feel like I'm back in 2012 when everyone was so hyped about the movie.\n\n___\n\nI was planning to reread these books this year but with coming out in 2020 I'll rather wait closer to that release date.\nShow more",

            "content": "~SO THIS IS WHAT ALL THE FUSS IS ABOUT~\nTHE HUNGER GAMES is a fantastic, breathless and somewhat brutal read that once you start you simply can t put down again. Initially I had no idea what this book was about or what to expect in terms of YA writing, it had just been recommended to me by so many people and had such a buzz surrounding it that I had to find out for myself why. Well let me say I was not disappointed and have now joined the legions of Suzanne Collins fans in awaiting her next instalment.\n\nWritten along the lines of Stephen King s or Orwell s (I may be aging myself here) this story still feels very original and sucked me in completely with its modern day Survivor-esque retelling. The Hunger Games is the ultimate in reality TV, suspense, scripted realism, romance and survival that you should not miss.\n\nSet in a post apocalyptic future (although we frustratingly never learn the why's, how s or even when of this future.) This new communist-type America known as Panem has been divided into a Capital and its 12 districts. We follow 16 year old Katniss as she struggles to keep her starving family alive, hunting and gathering with her best friend Gale. Unbeknownst to her these are valuable skills as the annual hunger games are about to begin.\n\nEach year these games require two children from each district who are chosen based on a lottery system for compulsory participation. These televised games are then broadcast throughout Panem (with mandatory viewing) as the 24 contestants fight each other to the death, leaving just one victor at its violent conclusion. It s kind of like Survivor but instead of being voted off the island you have to kill your competitors. When Katniss s younger sister is chosen as the female contestant from their district Katniss volunteers to take her place. Then together with Peeta the other lottery winner they travel to the capital and begin preparations for the opening ceremonies and ultimately their death in The Hunger Games.\n\nOddly this has been written without paragraph breaks and I have to admit the first part of it dragged for me, as Katniss is groomed, clothed, and schooled by her entourage within the capital. However as soon as the games begin, lookout! By this point in the story you have become attached to several key characters and its then that you realize things can t end well as there will be only one winner. Over a period of about 2 weeks and against overwhelming odds we watch 24 victims dwindle as they struggle to survive. Simultaneously avoiding and hunting each other they form alliances, face hunger and mind numbing thirst, mutant animal attacks, friendship, love and ultimately a distrust of everyone as Big Brother raises the stakes to keep the audience interested.\n\nThis is an exciting book that will keep you up late into the night and resonate with you long after you ve finished.

            "content": "I sat down to this book prepared to be captivated in its pages. But I was disappointed. I was always expecting that finally the author would show her genius and knock me off my feet. But it never happened. Yes, it was exciting and entertaining. But it wasn't a truly great book.\n\nI could not stop comparing this to Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury. Like Fahrenheit 451, it was a dystopian novel set in the future, but Fahrenheit 451 had significant symbolism on every page, paragraph, and even half the sentences. I was so scared because it was so life-like and realistic. I could see how undeniably prophetic Bradbury was and how we are slowly, ever so slowly, slipping closer and closer to that world. I saw the similarities of the worlds; I felt inspired to stop us from falling into that trap too.\n\nBut The Hunger Games never provoked me to think or inspired me to act. It was like a roller-coaster. You get on and momentarily take an exciting spin. But that's all. You're just taken there. You're not drawn in. You don't have to do anything. You just sit there and your stomach flops over and over as opposed to your mind working, thinking, puzzling, imagining. The writing style wasn't even good, and the grammar was actually quite poor. What really annoyed me about the writing style was that I knew paragraphs before if something exciting was going to happen. Just the way that Suzanne Collins wrote blew away the whole surprise and shock of an attack.\n\nI ended up asking, \"So what?\" She could have awoken the reader to real problems by showing us what could happen if we don't take action. But she never really got to the point. She focused instead on entertaining us, on giving us a sob story. There was so much potential in this book. What I'm trying to say is that there was so much that Suzanne Collins could have done to make this book a masterpiece like Fahrenheit 451. But she just didn't.\n\nI do want to read the next book though. I'll take another ride on the roller-coaster.\nShow more",

            "content": " This is a different kind of army. If you look at history you ll see men fight for pay, or women, or some other kind of loot. They fight for land, or because a king makes them, or just because they like killing. But we re here for something new. I don t   this hasn t happened much in the history of the world. We re an army going out to set other men free. \n\nColonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain\n\n\n\n\nI hadn t really thought about how unusual it is in the history of the world for men to be fighting for the freedom of others. It was one of many times while reading this book that Michael Shaara crystallized some thoughts for me. I love those moments when I read something, and I know without a shadow of a doubt that another tumbler has clicked into place. With every click I have come one step closer to understanding everything. ( a mad thought that doesn t last long) So the North was preserving the Union and freeing the slaves, but what exactly where the boys in butternut fighting for.\n\n\n\n33% of Southerners owned slaves. Mississippi and South Carolina had much higher percentages at 49% and 46%. So why did all those Southern boys rich and poor fight for the  rats to keep slaves? Most Southern Americans, as do most Americans today, had an expectation that they would be rich someday, the eternal optimists. Those poor white sharecropper farmers aspired to be slave owners. It is the same reason why I hear people who live below the poverty line saying they didn t believe it was  rat that the government was taxing the one percenters more than the rest of us. It doesn t make sense, but then they...might...just win the lottery...someday.\n\n\n\n\nThis book is centered around the three days of the battle of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania. Robert E. Lee, overall commander of the Confederate army and GOD to many, is trying to make a final thrust North to force the Union to seek terms. His men loved him unconditionally.\n\n\n\nHe is a different man than he was at the start of the war. Some would say he is a brilliant tactician, but if you walk the grounds of the battle of Gettysburg which I have not had that opportunity physically, you will discover that Lee gave his generals an impossible task. The battle smells of desperation. Shaara makes the case that Lee was already suffering from the heart condition that would eventually kill him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLee was feeling weak and mortal at Gettysburg. He wanted the war ended now. It certainly clouded his judgement. He was a man of faith and honor. In Pennsylvania he put too much faith in God finding his cause righteous and he depending too heavily on the honor of his troops to make it to that grove of trees at the top of the hill. He had a brilliant commander in Lieutenant General James Longstreet. Longstreet argued to slide around the enemy and to fight another day. If truth be known he disagreed with this whole thrusting North business. He wanted to build trenches and fight a defensive war. You don t win glorious honorable battles fighting a defensive war and Lee was addicted to winning battles. There is a whiff of Shakespearean tragedy around Longstreet.\n\n\n\nHe was a strong, commanding figure until he got around Lee.\n\n\n\nHe was an eccentric as well. He was living more in his mind than in his body.\n\n\n\nLee counted on him, but unfortunately he would have traded Longstreet for Stonewall Jackson every day of the week and twice on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\nShaara also takes us into the minds of Union men like General John Buford who arrived at Gettysburg and realized the importance of deploying troops on the high ground against a superior Confederate force. He knew he had to hold out until reinforcements arrived. He d done this before.\n\n\n\nWhat impressed me about Buford was his ability to think out of the box and adapt to any situation. Unfortunately for the Union he didn t have long to live or his name may have been further immortalized in Civil War history books.\n\n\n\n\nThere was also Colonel Joshua Chamberlain who commanded the 20th Maine. He was a school teacher by trade, a professor at Bowdoin before the war broke out. He and the Maine troops were positioned at the far left of the Federal line. He was on Little Round Top facing the seasoned veteran General John B. Hood. Hood was a Longstreet man and firmly believed in the concept of a defensive war. Despite their objections to Lee s tactics Hood and Longstreet did everything they could to obtain the objectives.\n\n\n\n\nChamberlain s men fired until they ran out of bullets and then Chamberlain in an act of desperation yelled:\n\n\n\nChamberlain and his remaining men charged down the hill in the face of enemy fire and because of the ferocity of their attack Hood s men turned and retreated.\n\nThere are descriptions of battles so elegantly told that the horror is somewhat mitigated by the eloquence of Shaara s writing. Bravery is not just for Custeresque men like General Winfield Scott Hancock who inspired such loyalty from his acquaintances, even those dressed in gray, such as his best friend General Lewis Armistead. Shaara describes the true crisis of consciousness these officers were facing. Most of them had fought together in the Mexican-American war, went to West Point together, drank together, and had been united as one before this war where politics forced them to choose sides against the friends they had once fought with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of this book I felt I knew all these men as intimately as I know friends I ve known for decades. It is as if Shaara raised them from the dead, one by one. They are talking skeletons with nothing but truth rattling through their teeth. Their souls are showing through their pale gray ribcages enscrolled with their most intimate thoughts. They hid nothing from Shaara not their fears or their desires. The war has never been more real to me. Highly recommended!\n\nIf you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit\nI also have a Facebook blogger page at:\nShow more",

            "content": " Once Chamberlain had a speech memorized from Shakespeare and gave it proudly, the old man listening but not looking, and Chamberlain remembered it still.  What a piece of work is man in action how like an angel!  And the old man, grinning, had scratched his head and then said stiffly,  Well, boy, if he s an angel, he s a murderin  angel.  \n- Michael Shaara, The Killer Angels\n\n\nWhen it was first published, Michael Shaara s landed with a thud. Even when it won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1975, it did not gain a wide following. When Shaara passed away in 1988, he did so believing his novel to have underachieved (as far as Pulitzer Prize winners can ever be so considered). Then, in 1993, the film version, , was released in theaters. Though it did not prove a runaway box office hit, it did enough to lift onto the bestseller lists.\n\nAccording to Shaara s son, Jeff (who can start a bank with the books he s sold by aping his father s distinctive techniques), was initially greeted with skepticism due to its release at the tail end of the Vietnam War. Maybe, or maybe not. The world, after all, is filled with great books that never found wide audiences.\n\nStill, there is some validity in the point. is decidedly old-fashioned. It has none of the cynicism or darkness of modern war novels. I wouldn t go so far as to say this is a pro-war book, but it embraces martial virtues with both its arms. In the world of , when the characters aren t thinking about duty, loyalty, and honor, they are giving speeches about it.\n\nbegins on the eve of the Civil War battle of Gettysburg, and takes us through each of the three bloody days as the Union and Confederacy clashed in the fields and hills around a small Pennsylvania crossroads village. In order to tell this story, Shaara employs viewpoint chapters in which the battle unfolds through the eyes of a limited number of characters. The characters are: the Confederate scout, Harrison; Confederate generals Robert E. Lee, James Longstreet, and Lewis Armistead; the British observer Fremantle; Union General John Buford; and Union Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, of the 20th Maine (whose posthumous reputation has spiked drastically because of this).\n\nThough the writing is in the third-person, each of the viewpoint chapters sticks to the thoughts, feelings, and actions of the chosen character. This leads to the kind of telescoping that is familiar to anyone who has read . While we are ostensibly being treated to epic events, it sometimes feels like we re viewing it through a keyhole. By focusing so rigidly on a handful of participants, you get a great sense of intimacy, at a loss of some of the scope.\n\nIt s impossible to talk about without mentioning Shaara s amazing style. He has an incredible eye for detail, the weather, the terrain, the colors, the sounds. He wraps you in these details until you feel like you re present on the field. You feel like you could take this book to Gettysburg and find your way around. At times, he slips easily into a hypnotic stream-of-consciousness, punctuated by the use of the present tense, interior monologues, and his trademarked sentence fragments. (Though, if we re being technical, I think Jeff Shaara has the trademark now).\n\nShaara s genius is in his characterizations. He brings Buford and Chamberlain and the others to life by embodying them, by inhabiting their minds. There is Lee, suddenly very old, suffering from heart disease, struggling with the loss of Jackson, unable to control his subordinates or get them to see his vision. He is courtly, saintly, pervaded by an unfortunate fatalism he wraps in a vague theology ( It s in God s hands now,  he intones repeatedly). There is Chamberlain, a professor of rhetoric, questioning everything, his thoughts, his actions, a true believer in the cause of freedom and Union, though he is constantly trying to define those things. And then there is Armistead, who gets only one chapter, during Pickett s Charge, but remains perhaps the most powerful creation, a doomed romantic, mourning his broken friendship with Union General Winfield Hancock. In a novel short of female characters, the remembered bonds between Hancock and Armistead provide the love story.\n\nThe best testament to the power of Shaara s vision is that his fictionalized conception of these real life figures has gained such widespread traction. For instance, Shaara used Longstreet s memoirs in his research; as such, Longstreet arises as something of a prophet, a man who can see the trenches of World War I just over the horizon, who believes that Lee s aggressiveness will destroy the Confederacy. While effective, it is worth noting that Shaara s concept of these men is not necessarily shared by all historians.\n\nis not a graphic or gratuitous book. There are no curse words. Despite the presence of thousands of men, there is nary a dirty thought in the air. The violence is rather tame, at least relatively speaking. Yet Shaara still manages to deliver marvelous battle scenes, especially a memorable accounting of Pickett s failed assault on the Union center.\n\n\n\ndoes have its share of flaws, though they are slight. The cast of characters, for one, is a bit imbalanced. On the Confederate side, Longstreet is a Corps commander, while Lee is in charge of the whole Army. Meanwhile, on the Union side, Buford is in charge of a cavalry division, and disappears after the first day. Chamberlain commands only a regiment. This means you get a great sense of the Confederate strategy, while the Union strategy is reduced to slandering General George Meade (who, despite Shaara s odd intransigence, was more than capable).\n\nThen there is the handling of slavery. Shaara acknowledges   or has his characters acknowledge   slavery as the root cause of the war on several occasions. He even has Longstreet admitting this. But Shaara also includes an interaction between Chamberlain and a runaway slave that I found a bit underdeveloped. In the scene, Chamberlain, despite his high ideals, finds himself revolted by the runaway, who is described in animal-like terms. The idea of exploring racism among Northern characters is not necessarily bad; if given the proper space, it might even have been meaningful. Unfortunately, Shaara never really expounds on the notion, leaving us with the disconcerting fact that Chamberlain is the only one in the book who is remotely racist. I feel like the inclusion of this requires an obverse scene, maybe one in which Lee oversees his men kidnapping and re-enslaving the unfortunate blacks who tarried in the invasion path. (Which is a thing that actually happened).\n\nThese are really minor critiques. And yes, I understand this is a novel with a very specific storyline. Still, it bears mentioning, if only because this is a very good piece of historical fiction, and when historical fiction is really, really good, you sometimes start to forget it s fiction and believe it's historical. But while heavily researched (with the inclusion of more maps than you get in typical history volume), it is, when all is said and done, a product of imagination.\n\ndeserves its place in the pantheon of great American war novels. It is a fascinating study in command, so much so that it is often recommended to military officers in training. More than that, it is a touching exploration of the bonds and friendships between men, and the sentimental notion that these relationships mean more than nations. It is no surprise that Shaara chose the famous lines from E.M. Forster s essay, , as his epigraph.  I hate the idea of causes,  Forster wrote,  And if I had to choose between betraying my country and betraying my friend I hope I should have the guts to betray my country. \nShow more",

            "content": "Michael Shaara's passion gave life to something unique and singularly extraordinary in this Pullitzer Prize winning novel. With high-charged, emotive prose, lush descriptions and fully-fleshed characters, he transforms the The Battle of Gettysburg, the bloodiest engagement of the Civil War, into a gorgeously rendered and deeply personal story populated by flawed, ordinary men caught in an extraordinary concatenation of circumstances by the machinations of Fate. Shaara s reduction of this momentous event into a tapestry woven of a myriad of individual observations and subjective accounts so seamlessly alternates between heart- and heart-that your own may need an overhaul by the time your finished.\n\nShaara s approach for this story was so revolutionary at the time that he couldn t even find a publisher willing to distribute his novel. Recounting the period of June 30-July 3, 1863 (the day before and the 3 days of the Battle of Gettysburg), Shaara s narrative filters the events surrounding the battle through the subjective lens of the leaders of the two armies. Today, his approach has been mimicked so often by those inspired by his achievement that it s likely to feel familiar to those reading it for the first time (see reference to Ken Burn s Civil War below). However, back in 1975, it was fresh and daring and unique.\n\nShaara jumps back and forth between dozens of viewpoints, each serving an important function and providing a unique perspective on the events surrounding the conflict. The most notable players in Shaara s epic play are: : Commanding General Robert E. Lee, General George Pickett, General James Longstreet, and British Col. Arthur Freemantle; and : Commanding General George Meade, General John Buford andCol. Josh Chamberlain. Through these soldiers and many others, Shaara emphasizes the motivations, decisions and actions of these men and how each of their unique and very human perspectives along with the ever present  fog of war  resulted in the final outcome at Gettysburg.\n\nNot being a Civil War buff, there was one part early in the story that I found fascinating to read. According to Shaara (and many historians I have come to find), one ambiguous order on the part of General Lee to his conservative cream-puff of a subordinate General, Richard Ewell, the South may very well have won the Battle of Gettysburg and drastically changed the outcome of the Civil War. Here is the order by General Lee as recounted by Shaara:\n\nFour simple words, were enough  wiggle room  to permit Ewell to justify ignoring Lee s order and deciding against taking Cemetery Hill. This inaction allowed the Union to entrench themselves on the higher, well defended ground. Shaara goes on to make it clear (through Lee s own personal musings) that if hard-charging, BSD Gen. Stonewall Jackson had not been killed weeks earlier, Cemetery Hill would ve been taken and the outcome of the battle, and possibly of history, dramatically altered.\n\nAnother moment of the novel that I found simply breath-stealing was the description of the battle of . A single regiment of Union soldiers (the 20th Maine), held off a superior force of confederate charges for well over an hour until they finally ran out of ammunition. With the confederate soldiers still advancing and no retreat possible:\nThe result was that the soldiers from the South broke in the face of the furious charge and the Union held Little Round Top. The fact that Chamberlain was a citizen solider (being a college professor before volunteering for the army) and yet acted so competently and with such courage was amazing to experience.\n\nQuite simply, this is an extraordinary novel. However, for two completely subjective (and probably unfair) reasons, I have elected to only rate this as a very strong 4 stars. : is that the Civil War is not favorite period of American history and so my juices don t flow as strongly when reading stories from this time as others more smitten with the events. : goes by the name of and his brilliant mini-series, . That masterpiece has ruined me for all other depictions of the conflict.\n\nThe great irony is that Shaara s novel was a major influence on Burns s decision to create his mini-series in the first place and Burns adopted to a great degree the tone and style employed by Shaara. Alas, Ken Burns got to me first and his more expansive description of the war and the causes thereof keep him firmly dug in at the top of the charts.\n\nStill, a strong, strong, strong 4.5 stars and my HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!\nShow more",

            "content": "An excellent rendering of the days of the Battle of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania by author, Michael Shaara. His lively and intuitive prose brings the principal players to life and gives insight into the men of the blue and the gray. There s a portentous aura in Shaara s portrayal of the men and their thoughts as the battle approaches. After all, I know how it turns out. When an author writes,  he was thirty-eight and that was as old as he would ever be , clouds gather and grow dark with the knowledge of the fate of all that are to die in what is known as the bloodiest battle on American soil. As the sword of Damocles is unsheathed, lives are held in the balance without regard for politics or affiliation. These thoughts predominate throughout my reading.\n\nIn the days leading up to the great battle, however, the men are marching, drinking, eating, telling jokes, and on the Confederate side, wondering about the whereabouts of their gallant leader of cavalry, Lieutenant General J.E.B. Stuart. Responsible for letting Robert E. Lee s Army of Northern Virginia know about the movements of the Army of the Potomac, Stuart fails to deliver. In the end, the vital information comes from the Confederate spy, Henry Thomas Harrison. Like the hub of a wheel, all the action that followed revolved around Harrison s information.\n\nOn the Union side, Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, thirty-four, is faced with what to do about the Maine mutineers. Their old company, the Second Maine was disbanded when the majority of the men had fulfilled their two-year commitment to the army. 120 of them, however, had signed up for three years. They had signed on to fight with the Second only, they said, but their commanders had other ideas, sending them under guard back to the fight. Wouldn t it be fine for them to join Chamberlain, Maine s 20th Regiment of Infantry. If they didn t think so, Chamberlain had permission to shoot them. In his former life, Chamberlain had been a professor of rhetoric at Bowdoin College. He fed the mutineers first, then gave them a speech, one that he believed in. It must have been a good one because all but six agreed to return to the fight.\n\n\n\nAccording to a NY Times opinion piece by Phil Leigh,  Making  Killer Angels   dated June 28, 2013, Michael Shaara spent seven years of meticulous research, delving into old diaries and private memoirs and letters to fashion something new in the world of historical fiction. He uses actual and fictional dialogue to create the perspective of actual participants. While I appreciate Shaara s rendition of The Battle of Gettysburg, I appreciate even more the necessity to use it as a springboard for more research into accounts that are strictly historical, balancing each added piece of information against others.\n\nShaara depicts Lee as being the most loved man on both sides, but I don t learn quite enough about why this is so. It s obvious the Confederate soldiers are willing to put themselves in harm s way to serve him and  The Cause.   The Cause  is voiced as being states  rights which includes the right to own slaves.\n\nThe Union Army as I understand it felt resentful of instructions from Washington, D.C., and as though the armchair generals didn t know enough about what was happening on the ground to make important decisions. According to the NY Times article I referenced earlier, Shaara  resurrected Chamberlain as a hero, and he has remained one of the most popular figures associated with the battle ever since.  As a professor turned soldier, and with great success against unlikely odds, he easily captured my attention.\n\nShaara also captures exceptionally well how the Civil War divided families and friendships. The friendship between General Lewis Addison Armistead from North Carolina (who would serve in the Confederate Army) and General Winfield Scott Hancock (who would serve for the Union Army) is beautifully illustrative. Was the friendship as close as Shaara would have us believe? Not according to  Armistead and Hancock Rethinking the Storied Friendship Between Two Opposing Gettysburg Generals, an article at miltaryhistorynow.com, dated November 27, 2022, but it did exist. On the last day of the battle, Armistead s brigade penetrated further into the Union Army than any other, and it was Hancock s troops he faced. When Armistead is fatally wounded, Hancock, not too far away, is also wounded. One of Hancock s officers, Union Captain Henry Bingham,  attended to the fallen Armistead on Cemetery Ridge. When Armistead learned of the connection, he identified Hancock as an  old and valued friend.  Armistead would die on July 5th from his wounds, while Hancock would survive. Shaara s embellishments on this friendship serves in my mind, to tell the stories of multitudes of other families and friendships, relations cut in two.\n\nA noteworthy book, engaging, and easily read. I learned a lot and that I don t know near enough.\nShow more",

            "content": "Visceral. That s the best word I can use to describe The Killer Angels, both in the sense of instinctive or elemental emotions and in the sense of internal organs and guts. Because both are relevant when you re talking about a book that captures what I imagine the experience of war to be like in a way that very few other books I ve ever read has.\n\nThe big caveat there, of course, is the  I imagine  part I ve never been a soldier, have never fired anything other than a BB gun (though, in my callous youth, I did bring to a premature conclusion the life of more than one recalcitrant soda can), and have absolutely no idea what it s like to kill another human (or have another human try to kill me); Jebus willing, I never will. So, it s possible that war is nothing like this.\n\nBut, Shaara s lean but descriptive prose and shifting POVs offer a perspective that feels so authentic that I found myself occasionally forgetting that this is a novel rather than a stitching together of first-hand narratives; one suspects Mr. Shaara did his homework. There s a reason this book is a classic of its genre, and it s simultaneously an enlightening and painful read.\n\nThe American Civil War is, if not unique in the history of warfare, certainly a particularly unusual conflict, especially when you consider the officers leading the troops on both sides of the fight. Many had served together previously in the United States army and for a not inconsiderable period of time which meant that you had colleagues, and in some cases good friends, whose job it was to go out and try to kill each other in the name of the geography into which they happened to have been born, putting aside their own personal feelings about the reasons for the war. (Side note: I have a few colleagues I d be totally fine pointing the business end of my bayonet at, but it s unlikely that I would actually be able to eviscerate them if it came to that, though I d happily pour salt in their coffee.)\n\nShaara is not concerned with trying to explain the reasons for the Civil War, nor in making a case for whether those reasons were good ones or not; his goal is to capture the experience of the fight. He does so masterfully; I felt completely immersed in the (very troubling) experience of preparing to fight, from the oddly relaxed downtime between battles to the gut-liquidating moments before the charge.\n\nThis is one of those books that will sit with me for a while, and one that reminds me that even when justified and I have a much higher threshold for justification than most rulers/countries over the course of human history war is an awful, horrific, terrible thing that indelibly transforms the lives of all those involved, whether directly engaged in the battle, the family members of those combatants, or the civilians whose homes and towns are destroyed in the process.\n\nI think I may need a little Dr. Seuss as a palate cleanser before jumping into anything else this heavy \n\n(Thanks to Allie for the buddy read!)\nShow more",

            "content": "This month marked the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg which we all know is the fight that took place when Abraham Lincoln wanted to make a speech at that address and then one of the neighbors got mad and challenged him. Or something like that.\n\nAh, but seriously folks . Gettysburg was the turning point of the American Civil War in which the Union forces defeated Robert E. Lee s invading Confederate troops, but this isn t a non-fiction book about the battle. Instead it s a historical fiction in which author Michael Shaara used research and literary license to put us into the minds of several key figures so that readers experience the fight through their eyes.\n\nFor this re-read, I listened to the audible version, and it featured an interesting introduction from Shaara s son, Jeff. (Who has followed his late father s formula to write several other books about American history.) The younger Shaara tells of how his father s book was rejected over a dozen times, was a commercial flop but won a Pulitzer Prize only to see no increase in its profile following the award. Michael died in 1988 thinking that the book would not be remembered. In an twist of fate, the movie adaptation that came out five years later would put the book on the best seller list almost twenty years after it was originally published.\n\nOn the Confederate side, an ailing and weary Robert E. Lee has pinned his hopes to end the war on the idea of attacking and destroying the Union army on it s own ground, but his top general, James Longstreet, was against the invasion since he believes the South s military success has come from a defensive style of warfare. As they advance into Pennsylvania, they ve been left with a dangerous lack of information about Union movements because cavalry officer J.E.B. Stuart has been failing to provide them with reports from his scouting mission.\n\nBoth sides begin to converge on the small town of Gettysburg which has a valuable crossroads nearby, but Union cavalry officer John Buford is there first and immediately realizes that the hills and slopes outside of the town will give a huge advantage to the army that holds them. With the Confederate forces closing in fast, Buford occupies and tries to hold the good ground while urging the Union army to rush in and reinforce him. As troops pour into the area from both sides, they find themselves fighting in a battle no one had counted on. The Union troops manage to occupy the better positions as Longstreet desperately tries to convince Lee that attacking would be a major mistake, but Lee believes that his army can destroy the Union forces once and for all.\n\nThis book and the subsequent film version would do a lot to make people reevaluate Longstreet s reputation. He d been scapegoated by other Confederate officers after the war for the defeat at Gettysburg, but Shaara s version of events based on letters and diaries of those involved makes a convincing argument that it was Lee whose stubborn refusal to disengage and pick a better spot for a fight was the main culprit for the Confederate failure.\n\nShaara also credits the forgotten Buford with being a major reason as to why the Union was able to seize the high ground. He also tells the story of another officer forgotten by mainstream American history as one of the true heroes of the battle. Joshua Chamberlain was a professor at Maine s Bowdoin College when the war broke out, but he showed a knack for military command that eventually put him in charge of a regiment at the end of the Union line on a hill called Little Round Top. As the extreme left position of the Union forces, Chamberlain and his men had to hold back repeated efforts to flank them by Longstreet s troops, and then they found themselves in the thick of the fighting again on the last day during Pickett s Charge.\n\nChamberlain would win the Congressional Medal of Honor for his actions at Gettysburg, and he would continue to serve with distinction for the rest of the war. Eventually promoted to the rank of brigadier general, Ulysses Grant chose Chamberlain to command the Union troops at the surrender ceremony. After the war, he would win multiple terms as Maine s governor as well as eventually becoming president of his old college. (Feeling like a slacker yet?) The book and a great performance by Jeff Daniels in the movie version would make Chamberlain remembered once again.\n\nThe prose gets a bit flowery at times, but Shaara s preface notes that he actually toned down the verbose style of the time. There s also a bit too much repetition on a couple of points like Chamberlain s horror at himself that he ordered his brother to fill a gap in the line during the fight on Little Round Top without a second thought or Confederate General Armistead s constant references to his friend Win Hancock as he frets that he ll have to face his buddy on the battle field.\n\nThose are minor gripes about a book that found a new and fresh way to tell a story that every American school kid has heard. Shaara also does a nice job of pointing out the inherent hypocrisy of the Confederates who claim to be fighting for their rights while not mentioning that what they want is the freedom to keep owning slaves. That point gets overlooked a lot when the South gets romanticized in mainstream works of fiction, and it s refreshing that Shaara called bullshit on it.\n\nRandom trivia: Joss Whedon s television show Firefly was partially inspired by his reading of this book.\n\nAlso posted at\nShow more",

I have trouble envisioning the action and the maneuvers of the troops, and I find that I get lost in the details and just don't really care about the characters.\n\nBecause of this, I didn't have high hopes for The Killer Angels, but it was this month's selection for my book club, and I decided to give it a try.\n\nThis book was incredible. I did have some trouble keeping track of the characters. I ended up making myself a cheat-sheet with things like, \"Longstreet - Confederate general. Lee's second-in-command. Nickname: Pete.\" Actually, Longstreet I could keep track of. It was Pettigrew and Pender and Sykes and Sedgewick that kept tripping me up. The maps were very helpful as I tried to visualize the action, but they were less helpful when I couldn't remember which names were Union and which were Confederate.\n\nThis is a novel, so it's a fictionalized account of the Battle of Gettysburg, but Shaara clearly did his research. Written from the shifting perspective of the main players in the battle and drawn from the personal correspondence of these men as well as the historic record and Shaara's own embellishments and best guesses, this book explains the nuances of the battle and of the war more clearly than I've read before. I've been taught the Civil War from the perspective that there was a clear side to root for. I've known for a long while that the reality was murkier than this, but Shaara helped make this murkiness more apparent to me (or perhaps I'm just now of an age where I can embrace murkiness better than I could in high school and college). There is a distinction here between the Cause and the people doing the fighting. I don't think that's a distinction I've often seen.\n\nShaara puts the reader in Gettysburg, not only in the location but in the minds of the people who were there. All of the things people say about the Civil War---the idea of brothers fighting against brothers, the internal conflict and sense of near heresy of killing one's own countrymen, the ambivalence of Northerners to the people the slaves were even as they disagreed with the institution of slavery---Shaara illustrates clearly here.\n\nThe book is peppered with lyrical, powerful passages, but two stand out for me as particularly moving.\n\nOne is a speech Chamberlain gives to a group of would-be deserters handed over as prisoners to his brigade to try and convince a few of them to fight rather than just ride out the battle as prisoners.\n\n\"This is a different kind of army,\" Chamberlain explains. \"If you look at history you'll see men fight for pay, or women, or some other kind of loot. They fight for land, or because a king makes them, or just because they like killing. But we're here for something new. I don't...this hasn't happened in the history of the world. We're an army going out to set other men free.\"\n\nThe other passage that really struck me was when Longstreet and Hood were saying goodbye to one another before a fight. Longstreet puts out his hand for Hood to shake.\n\n\"Hood took the hand, held it for a moment. Sometimes you touched a man like this and it was the last time, and the next time you saw him he was cold and white and bloodless, and the warmth was gone forever.\"\n\nI just found the way Shaara uses language to be powerful, poignant, but not overdone at all. He has a light touch which lets the scenes shine through. The writing was easy to read, the story rather less so.\n\nI think I can blame this book at least in part for the gloomy mood I've been in the past few days. It's an incredible book about an infamously dark battle in our country's darkest war.\nShow more",

It puts us inside the head of the generals and soldiers, and in doing so, tells us the story of the Southern aristocracy and their dependence on slavery, the sense of honor in these men on both sides, and the pride of the fighting men. It had me in tears a few times for the waste and the loss of lives, and admiration for the Generals who had those lives in their charge.

Sylvia Plath masterfully draws the reader into Esther's breakdown with such intensity that Esther's insanity becomes completely real and even rational, as probable and accessible an experience as going to the movies. Such deep penetration into the dark and harrowing corners of the psyche is an extraordinary accomplishment and has made The Bell Jar a haunting American classic.",

            "content": "There are many who have read The Bell Jar and absolutely loved it. I am gladly considering myself one of them. I was a little caught of guard when I read a few reviews of The Bell Jar comparing it to The Catcher in the Rye stating how it's the female version of it. I liked Catcher but I know there are many people who didn't and upon hearing that may be similar to Catcher not have the desire to read it. I assure you, The Bell Jar is a book all on it's own and should not be compared to any other book... even as a compliment.\n\nWhen I first started reading the book I was a little put off, feeling it was an extremely pretensious novel. Her descriptions were crisp and precise, often using words that one rarely hears spoken or even read. I went into the novel knowing that Plath was a poet and felt that at first the book was just another form of her poetry and her showing off her writing abilities. But that only remained within the first two pages, because after that I became absorbed. The writing that I was a little sketchy about at first helped me visualize the setting and get to know the characters. And though Plath never really described many characters as to their personality, I began to feel I knew them all intimately.\n\nStrangely enough, if you remember in my last review, what bothered me most about did not bother me in . Because the Esther, the character we are following, is slowly descending into madness, time no longer matters. There are a few times I was confused about the timeline, but it did not upset me.\n\nThe book really spoke to me because of my own personal experiences with depression and suicide. It spoke to me as a woman and my views on sex and the confusion I'm sure most other girls out there face. It's amazing that this book was written and published over 30 years ago, really, when a new woman was coming out into the world. I have a feeling that this book helped women realize that they're not alone, and brought things to light that most people have commonly shoved aside; women men. But what else is amazing is how relevant these topics still are today. Specifically with suicide, and specifically about the virtue and pureness of women compared to men.\n\nSo I guess that is why is often compared to , with it's discussions and writings of often controversial titles. Setting off a new generation of writers, styles, and people. Another book also came to mind as I was reading, and that was . There are moments when I could make a few direct comparisons between the two. With Esther slowly seperating herself from socialization and sinking deeper into her own thoughts and depression. Analyzing things that go on around her and her surroundings. Very reminscent of .\n\nIf you feel you're suffering from depression, madness, confusion about topics pertaining to society and sex, or just looking for a good read, is definetly the book for you. I also advise, if you're seriously suffering from depression, to get help for yourself. There is no shame in it, and getting help is better than ending your life. Even if you need to go on medication, DO NOT feel ashamed, especially if it's going to help you even more.\nShow more",

(it has since been soundly defeated.) anyway, i didn't know classic fiction could be like this: written by a woman, fresh and relatable, about someone like me.\n\nthat wasn't my experience upon reread.\n\nin the intervening years, i've read some of plath's poetry in other classes, and found it a little gaudy and self-indulgent for my taste. (you can yell at me if you want to but i don't think either of those are untrue. or even really insults.) so i always wondered if the bell jar would hold up if i read it again.\n\nthe answer: no, but not for any reason i expected!\n\nthis is racist and homophobic as f*ck. it's genuinely disturbing. this was written in the second half of the 20th century, in the midst of the civil rights movement. the march on washington took place in the same year as this book's publication. among legitimate intellectual and/or progressive circles of the time, this manner of thinking is grotesquely out of line.\n\nit seems especially absurd in the face of plath's dogged dedication to the Rights Of Women. feminism is important, of course, but reading about how the greatest social issue in plath's eyes (or the eyes of plath's self-insert protagonist) was women being able to be writers and editors with as much ease as they could be secretaries (as opposed to the several editors and writers there were) is kind of insane. obviously employment access is crucial, but the lack of self-awareness is apparent, no?\n\nthis also has two of my least favorite clich d traits of mental health depiction:\n1) a protagonist that blames everyone else for their mental illness, and\n2) Grand Gestures Of Depression.\n\nbaby, i wish my mental illness included me doing things like whimsically throwing shirts at the city of new york while my hair blew in the wind. it's usually a lot more of me laying in bed and watching tiktoks.\n\ni guess that doesn't fit the seminal work criteria.\n\nin short: i love unlikable protagonists. it's just that i hated this one.\n\nbottom line: we all have an unpopular opinion, right? a beloved book we hate? let me have this one in peace.\n\n--------------------\n\n\nrereading this on the beach so i can be the edgiest girl there\nShow more",

            "content": "I feel like I owe Sylvia Plath an apology. This is a book I actively avoided for years because so many people (namely female classmates who wanted to be perceived as painfully different or terminally misunderstood or on the verge of absolutely losing their teenage shit) lauded the virtues of this book and how it, like, so totally spoke to them in places they didn't even know they had ears. My own overly judgmental high-school self could not accept even the remote possibility of actual merit lurking between the covers of something that such bland, faux-distraught ninnies clung to like a life raft.\n\nI should probably also apologize for referring to every pair of oven mitts I've ever owned as a pair of Sylvias but I think the lady scribe in question was too mired in real problems to care all that much about my sick amusement's crass reduction.\n\n\"The Bell Jar,\" packed as it was with bleak truths, difficult topics and wryly dark humor, was not at all what I was expecting. Old biases die hard: I couldn't help but brace myself for a trivial tribute to mental imbalances, White Girl Problems and petty complaints disguised as life-ruining moments. What I got was an utter lack of histrionics and a sincere, to-the-point road map of one talented young lady's fight against her inner demons. Sylvia's alter ego Esther Greenwood (let's all take a second to appreciate the sly cleverness of trading \"Sylvia\" for the fictional surname \"Greenwood\") is so straightforward in addressing her despair that I couldn't help but extend more sympathy than I thought I could muster to her understated suffering. If nothing else, this book taught me that my own bouts of the blues are simply me being human and could be so much more debilitating: For that clarity of self-awareness alone, I am grateful.\n\nReading this as I neared the \"Infinite Jest\" finish line offered necessary perspective that helped me get a better idea of what it must have been like inside such a messy head. The relative ease with which IJ's depressed cast could self-medicate in secret or seek refuge where at least someone was trying to understand the extent of such gaping psychological wounds offered a jarring contrast to the way Sylvia/Esther seemed truly isolated from those who couldn't see how awful it was to live inside herself. While she encountered precious little understanding in both her personal life (Mrs. Greenwood's inability to see her daughter's problem as instead of wondering what she did wrong just rubbed my modern sensibilities the wrong way) and from the medical professionals who were tasked with helping her rise above the sinking despair she couldn't escape, I finished this fictionalized semi-autobiography 50 years after its publication with a keener understanding of what Sylvia Plath endured than I'm comfortable with.\nShow more",

There's hardly any comfort even when Esther is freed from the bell jar; on the contrary, it's a brutal reminder that this book is ultimately, part fiction.\n\nPlath's poetic prowess shows through her writing - especially the descriptions.

Here's another:\n\n\n\nThe writing is remarkably unemotional and I don't mean that as a bad thing. Esther's (or Plath's?) commentary dwells entirely on thoughts and perceptions, never feelings.

Essentially it came down to how dare I criticise a feminist cultural icon who suffered from mental illness and accuse her of racism, anti-Semitism and homophobia. And if she really was why has no one else pointed it out? That I am biased as fuck etc. Actually others have pointed it out. That was the point of my review, separating the artist from their work. But now it is also, why are differing views not allowed?\n\nI realise that we are living in the times where belief and feelings are considered much more important than science and facts, where democratic voting is wrong and illegal if the 'wrong party' (US) or Brexit or Scottish Independence (UK) don't go the way that people want. And that any dissension results in deplatforming, cancelling or immense campaigns of hatred against academic and public figures. Is this the right way to go? No dissension, no debate, facts are wrong if they don't fit feelings, and cultural icons for one movement or another can do no wrong?\n__________\n\nHow do we separate the artist from their art if we blithely don't notice it and then excuse them with saying it was a product of their times?\n\n\n\nWith Plath, whose book The Bell Jar I read in my teens, when I read this article today, July 6th, 2022, it absolutely shocked me How could I not have noticed or forgotten? Am I so inured and hardened to White supremacist thinking - everyone else is 'other', and when I read I am reading as if was/am just white not 'other'\n, that when reading a much-lauded 'great' author my eyes are blinded?\n\n*\"[W]e cannot discuss Sylvia Plath without approaching the subject of her blatant racism and disrespect for Black people and Jewish people.\"\n\n*\"Her poems crassly compare her suffering to that of the Holocaust and beyond her fiction, Plath s diaries dating back to her high school years show a history of hateful and disrespectful white supremacist thinking.\"\n\n*\"The viciousness of her comments about Jewish and Black people and the insensitive comparisons of her own struggles to those of the victims of the Holocaust show her to be completely out of touch with the era of progressive and civil rights activism\" in which she lived and obviously didn't agree with.\n\nAs another article says, you cannot understand Plath if you don't understand her very Germanic upbringing by the German father she loved and whose death she was never able to get over. In her diary, in 1958, she wrote of her father, \"He   heiled Hitler in the privacy of his home.\"\n\nOr maybe I didn't notice because I only read The Bell Jar and not Plath's poetry, I certainly would have picked it up from\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't say I wouldn't read these authors or even enjoy their works - I love Oscar Wilde and certain Roald Dahl books - but I think knowing who an author was, the kind of views they held obviously informs their works, and that is important even if I decide to separate art from the artist.\nShow more",

But the story is definitely about Esther, her ambition, and her own feelings of inadequacy, even though (viewed from the outside) Esther would be seen as a success.\n\nWhat is amazing about this writing is its immersive quality; you feel Esther s restrictive choices and alienation from her world because you ultimately realize the world she has been striving for was never in her grasp. The repeated questions (after she is being treated for her depression) about who will marry her now only reinforce the notion that for the intelligent and talented Esther Greenwood, there had never been a good way to extricate herself from a trap that she had always seen coming.

Questo   il suo unico romanzo, l unica opera in prosa (diari a parte).\n\n\n\n\nEppure,   scritto dimenticando la poesia, senza cercare lirismo, con uno stile diretto irriverente spiazzante, e agghiacciante, intriso d ironia fino al black humour, che mi ha particolarmente colpito per come sembra volare basso e per come non cambia registro nonostante la storia si trasformi e passi dalle esperienze e avventure di una giovane studentessa a una caduta nel baratro della depressione (o quello che era   a me sembra che la depressione   un etichetta che si appiccica un po  ovunque - da un po  di tempo lo si fa anche col bipolarismo).\n\nContinuando a scrivere nello stesso modo, dissacrante e non convenzionale, Plath divide la sua storia in tre fasi piuttosto ben distinte, che racconta in perfetta unit  di stile pur passando .\nIl risultato   ben pi  che notevole,   il primo regalo di questo romanzo molto molto bello.\n\n\n\nTre fasi: la prima   ambientata a New York nell estate del 1953.\nLa \"campana di vetro\"   resa ancora pi  manifesta, percepibile, quasi visibile, dall afa estiva che avvolge la citt .\nEsther, non ancora ventenne, sta facendo uno stage presso una rivista femminile. Alloggia in un albergo insieme ad altre ragazze, cerca insistentemente di liberarsi della sua verginit , vissuta come parte dell oppressione, fa vita modaiola, aspetta di essere ammessa a un corso di scrittura creativa, sta vivendo il suo rito iniziatico, accumula incontri ed esperienze, ma pi  di tutto accumula scollamento.\nInfatti, ci  che dovrebbe essere non corrisponde a ci  che sente: e quando scopre di non essere stata ammessa, si libera di tutti i suoi vestiti in una magnifica scena dal forte sapore simbolico, e inizia la sua caduta, comincia a disgregarsi (la  smarginatura  di Elena Ferrante).\n\n\n\nQui inizia la seconda fase, col ritorno a casa, a Boston, percepita come luogo molto provinciale, nella casa di famiglia, a stretto contatto con la mamma, e si sa che l amore   responsabile di molti misfatti   in questo caso,   certo che la presenza materna, il suo modo di voler bene alla figlia, la completa integrazione dell adulta alle regole imposte dalla societ , offrono a Esther una buona spinta verso un tentativo di suicidio e quello che poi succede nella terza fase.\nIl momento saliente, prima ancora del tentato suicidio, si manifesta quando Esther si accorge che la sua grafia   diventata illeggibile, storta e distorta come la sua mente e il suo modo di guardare la realt  delle cose.\n\nLa terza fase   dedicata alla cura e alla faticosa risalita verso la \"normalit \".\nDa una clinica all altra, da un intervento medico all altro, Esther sembra farcela, mentre invece Sylvia, che conosce il male di scrivere e quello di vivere, non ce la far .\n\n\n\nEsther non vuole sottostare alle regole, si sente un pesce fuor d acqua (in questo, certo, ricorda Holden), continua a ribellarsi alle scelte rigide e definitive (vedi il matrimonio, il promesso sposo) che le vengono imposte dall ambiente.\nEsther vorrebbe poter provare tutto, non essere ingabbiata, e Plath sceglie un immagine molto bella per esemplificare: l albero di fichi, dove ogni frutto rappresenta una vita diversa, e il desiderio di avere tutti i frutti paralizza Esther fino a che i fichi marciscono e cadono per terra.\n\nPi  che brividi, d  la scossa leggere degli elettroshock ai quali viene sottoposta la protagonista, sia nella forma massiccia che in quella pi  blanda (omeopatica?).\nE non si pu  non cogliere l agghiacciante parallelo con la vicenda dei Rosenberg giustiziati sulla sedia elettrica (riguarder  il film di Lumet).\n\n\n\nSembra riduttiva una lettura femminista di quest opera, che trascende l identificazione con la sola sfera femminile, come non   solo l'America spietata, borghese e maccartista degli anni Cinquanta ad apparire spaventosa, ma gli schemi sociali in genere: la campana di vetro che schiaccia la protagonista sotto il peso della sua protezione, togliendole l'aria, stritolandola nell ingranaggio di una normalit  che ignora la poesia, non riguarda solo Esther.\n\nCos  come, nonostante qualche analogia, a me sembra forzato il paragone con Holden, capolavoro a se stante che troppo spesso viene tirato (ma soprattutto stiracchiato) in ballo: in questo caso non c   neppure l adolescenza in comune, Esther per quanto frettolosa di liberarsi della sua (tardiva?) verginit ,   pi  grande di Holden, e si sa a quell et  della vita tre anni sono una differenza di secoli.\nNon basta l impossibilit  di ricomporre un  io diviso  per giocare nella stessa squadra.\nAnche se non   difficile capire che per le lettrici Esther possa aver significato quello che Holden ha significato per i lettori.\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\nShow more",

The author passed away one month after this book was published. The public was eager to find the similarities between Esther Greenwood and Ms. Plath at that time.\n\nEsther's depression and mental breakdown, electroconvulsive therapy, and suicide attempt are all shrewdly depicted by the author. There are multiple instances where the author sharply criticizes the patriarchal society in America at that time. The search for feminine independence is portrayed brilliantly with the help of the extraordinary narrative style. This is one of the best semi-autobiographical novels that I have read.\nShow more",

            "content": " because wherever I sat on the deck of a ship or at a street caf  in Paris or Bangkok I would be sitting under the same glass bell jar, stewing in my own sour air. \n  Sylvia Plath, The Bell Jar\n\n4.5 to 5 stars\n\nThis was a very powerful and only partially fictional tale from Sylvia Plath. Perhaps the genre should be called autobiographical fiction (is that already a thing?). Because of this, I was very glad that the book included a short biography of Plath at the end to compare her life experiences and her experiences with writing it to the final product. While now it might only seem somewhat shocking and controversial, at the time I am sure it was a book that people may have had to sneak so that others did not realize they were reading it.\n\nThe first half focused a lot on the main character s (Esther, and therefore Plath s) experience with the questionable behavior of men in her life. I believe what she deals with is what would now be called  toxic masculinity . The men she meets just treat her so very wrong and they don t even realize it. It s as if she is not even a person, just a personality-less flesh puppet to ply with drinks and  mansplain  things to. For those who watch the show Mad Men, I was reminded of the characters Peggy and Joan in the first few seasons who are trying to breakthrough to do the work the men do but are often talked down to as they are expected to be secretaries and housewives. I imagine if a traditional  manly man  in the 60s found his wife reading this he would have likely done something drastically inappropriate to her and thought nothing of it.\n\nThe second half of the book deals with depression, mental decay, and suicide. I felt so bad for Esther. She had issues, she needed help, and the help she received was so wildly inappropriate, it was infuriating. I was reminded of stories and movies from and set in that time period (Rosemary Kennedy and Angelina Jolie s character in the Movie Changeling to name a couple) where the answer to a woman experiencing mental struggles in the 50s and 60s might be to nonchalantly toss them into a sanatorium or have them lobotomized. Men who had the same issues were not treated the same, even some that were truly mentally disturbed, while a woman battling with what might have only been mild depression or manic behavior might find themselves locked away and receiving shock treatment. If this part of the book doesn t get you riled up, I would be surprised!\n\nIt should be very telling that Plath originally released this under a pseudonym because she was afraid of the response she would receive. If you have to hide reality behind a fake name and fictionalization, then I think that proves there is something very wrong with reality.\n\nThe Bell Jar is a must read. Some of the content may be hard to swallow, but it is a very powerful statement that will help humanity learn from its mistakes and avoid repeating them.\nShow more",

            "content": "This is, by far, the most disappointed I ve ever been when it came to a book.\nNot just with the book itself, but with how many people decided to ignore the racism taking place in it.\nI ve had this novel praised to me so many times that I idolized it for years before I even bought it. I was so scared that I wouldn t like it that I kept waiting to be in  the right mind-set  before I decided to finally pick it up.\nAbout a quarter into the book I had already encountered not one, but 3 racist comments made by Esther (the main character). And I was so surprised that no one ever mentioned this to me that I had to stop reading, go on goodreads and look at the reviews to see if anyone was addressing it, and nothing.\nSo I told myself I was reading too much into it and kept on reading, and by the 4th comment I was starting to lose it.\nSo I went online and looked it up, and the only thing that turned up was a personal blog and a goodreads thread that mostly blamed the racism on  the time the novel was written in , to which I would just like to say, and pardon my french, that s complete and utter bullshit.\nThis book was written in the 60s! The NINETEEN-60s!! in. the. middle. of. the. civil. rights. movement.\nAnd I m not saying racism didn t exist back then, hell, that s what the whole movement was about. And I get that people weren t  woke , and that using certain slang was normal back then, BUT I could name at least a dozen writers who didn t feel the need to be racist while writing from (what we all know is) their personal pov. Hell, I could name novels published in the 19th fucking century that advocated against racism. Sylvia could ve at least picked up ONE of those during her lifetime, jfc.\nI m not just speaking about the 5+ times she used the n word, it s not my place to say whether that was wrong or not. I m talking about the explicit racist comments (against more races than one, if I may add) that made me want to drench this book in gasoline, light it on fire then flush it down the fucking toilet:\n  In one part, Esther Greenwood describes her reflection as \"a big, smudgy-eyed Chinese woman staring idiotically into my face,\"\n  In another she says:  the face in the mirror looks like a sick Indian\"\n  At one point she calls indigenous Mexicans ugly and says things like \"dusky as a bleached-blonde negress\"\n  In a scene where Esther is being served dinner while in the mental health institute. The man serving her is described as a stupid, laughing, indolent Black man with huge, rolling eyes, a racist trope made popular with books like \"The Story of Little Black Sambo,\" which was published in 1898. During this scene, the man commits the  offense  of serving two types of beans for dinner, and Esther punishes him for it by kicking him.\n  When Esther s friend is telling her about a guy she s interested in, who happens to be from Peru, Esther replies with:  they're squat they're ugly as Aztecs.\"\n\n\n\nAll of that being said, I think I should mention that:\na/ the writing was actually pretty decent\nb/ I am not going to ignore the awareness it brought around mental health for so many years. But, if that s the only reason you re reading this, then I suggest you check out instead, it s equally as representative (if not more/better) of mental health, based on  s real life (it s more of a memoir-ish type), it includes plenty of documents and notes from her time in a mental health institute, and, most importantly, it isn t problematic.\nShow more",

            "content": " Doctor Gordon was unlocking the closet. He dragged out a table on wheels with a machine on it and rolled it behind the head of the bed. The nurse started swabbing my temples with a smelly grease.\n\nAs she leaned over to reach the side of my head nearest the wall, her fat breast muffled my face like a cloud or a pillow. A vague, medicinal stench emanated from her flesh.\n\n Don t worry,  the nurse grinned down at me.  Their first time everybody s scared to death. \n\nI tried to smile but my skin had gone stiff, like parchment Dr. Gordon was fitting two metal plates on either side of my head. He buckled them into place with a strap that dented my forehead, and gave me a wire to bite.\n\nI shut my eyes.\n\nThere was a brief silence, like an indrawn breath.\n\nThen something bent down and took hold of me and shook me like the end of the world. Whee-ee-ee-ee, it shrilled, through an air crackling with blue light, and with each flash a great jolt drubbed me till I thought my bones would break and the sap fly out of me like a split plant.\n\nI wondered what terrible thing it was that I had done  \n- Sylvia Plath,\n\nIn the early morning hours of February 11, 1963, Sylvia Plath sealed her children s room with masking tape, turned on the gas, and stuck her head in an oven. She was thirty years old.\n\nThis is a rather grim way to start a discussion of , but utterly necessary, because Plath s death haunts every page of this wonderfully-realized story of a woman descending into insanity. This is one of those instances where fiction and fact are so tightly interwoven that they cannot really be separated. That is, part of the power of comes from the palpable presence of Plath s ghost.\n\nReality casts a funereal pall over the proceedings, yet opens jauntily enough. first-person narrator Esther Greenwood announces in the novel s arresting first line, Esther, we soon learn, is in New York City, with a prestigious internship at a fashion magazine. There is a certain breeziness in the early going, so that it is not hard to conjure up an image from, say, : a tale of a young woman on the make, in the city that never sleeps.\n\nAs we move forward, however, Esther   who proves an endearing, self-deprecating narrator   struggles with the glitz and glam that others so eagerly seek. Her time in New York is not seamless, and several incidents, ranging from the amusing (there are some surprisingly funny moments) to the terrifying, starts to degrade Esther s mental condition.\n\nIt does not give too much away to say that is about Esther s declining mental health. The strength of , though, is partially derived from the fact that Esther, narrating in the first-person, never comes out and says,  then I went crazy.  Instead, Plath   through Esther   provides a precise, detailed, chilling presentation of Esther s loss of sanity by describing everything with matter-of-factness. Her psychotic  breaks  are not identified as such. Rather, Esther depicts both the real and the unreal in the exact same manner, so that there is a blurring between the two.\n\nYears ago, as a young defense attorney, I worked the mental health beat, representing indigent clients contesting their civil commitments. Quite unexpectedly, I found it one of the more fascinating and rewarding things I ve ever done. It was a job you could never plan for, and which could be funny, heartbreaking, and terrifying, all in the space of a few rapidly oscillating minutes in a confined space.\n\nThat period gave me a profound awe for the human brain. You are always told how remarkable is the mind, but sometimes you need to see something in relief to see it at all. Thus, in observing the functioning of  non-normal  brain chemistry, I saw the power firsthand. I met with people whose view of the universe was completely at odds with the reality I perceived, and yet they could hold onto this alternate-reality for years, spinning these amazing webs from which they could not break (and of which I sometimes became a part). For these people, it was impossible to detach delusion from non-delusion. The former became as strong as the latter, until the two became the identical sides of the same coin.\n\nThat s what makes the mid-section of so compelling. It contains Esther's scrupulously-detailed breakdown: a succession of doctors; a mother who doesn't understand and wants her to snap out of it; life in an asylum; electro-shock therapy; insulin therapy; and a black nurse s aide who feeds her two types of beans, which is the kind of detail that had me nodding my head in recognition. (So much of great fiction is in small, perfect details).\n\nBeyond that, Plath s Esther is blisteringly honest, and not just about matters of mental health. For instance, there is a scene where Esther loses her virginity that is told with a candor that is surprising today, not to mention the date when it was first published.\n\nAs to publication, became available in Britain   under a pseudonym   in 1963. Just a few months later, Plath took her own life, simultaneously cutting short a promising career, while launching a certain mythos. The novel did not arrive in America for several more years. When it did, it became an instant bestseller, and eventually, a classic. However, like John Kennedy Toole s , it is a strange classic, inextricably bound up in the death of its creator.\n\nRegardless of its baggage, could stand on its own. It is poignant, honest, unflinching. The prose is beautiful, touched with poetry. The ending is unforgettable.\n\nBut it would be wrong to separate from its baggage, because the novel and its context inform each other. There is a certain level of sadness here that simply cannot be escaped.\n\nYet Plath imbues with glints and glimmers of hope. There is a brief reference to Esther s future, a future free of hospitals and distortions and demons. It is clear that Esther   and by extension Plath   had some optimism for what lay ahead.\n\nWe know, of course, that Plath never reached that better day, but we can wish, even believe, that somehow Esther did.\nShow more",

            "content": "I think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound and stab us. If the book we are reading doesn't wake us up with a blow on the head, what are we reading it for? ...we need the books that affect us like a disaster, that grieve us deeply, like the death of someone we loved more than ourselves, like being banished into forests far from everyone, like a suicide. A book must be the axe for the frozen sea inside us.\n  Franz Kafka; January 27, 1904\n\n(Chapter 7)\n\nThere is a lulling silence engulfing this entire book, and if it weren t for the darkening clouds approaching, an infinite palette brimming with all the shades of creation, one may never guess that it is the calm before the storm. Amid the impending commotion, the ancient state of confusion hovering over this land, a tree has already started to sense the chaos. A fig tree is losing its branches, one by one, as the storm unleashes its fury and time passes us by. The house does no longer provides shelter; its white walls won t stop the cold, we see the ceiling yet we ll feel the rain. Crystals are besieging us. The captives in the world of glass feel it all.\n\n\n\nMy first encounter with Sylvia Plath s work was . It was a good read but it didn t leave me memorable impressions. Later I understood how excruciatingly personal her poetry was, thus missing a plethora of subtle vocals, strong undertones, harrowing melodies. After reading about her life and watching a biopic, the connection was absolutely different regarding, for instance, the same two poems I had read months ago. There may be a lack of lyrical substance, of the mellifluous quality in language worthy of all praises, but to me, the beauty of her verse lies on her honest display of emotions through complex and raw imagery. I find that openness refreshing. How unsafe it is to be on the brink of vulnerability, with a bunch of emotions for one person or a whole world to see. And yet, how brave; giving free expression to such feelings, turning them into creative energy. How invigorating. Even when no one is listening to anyone. Not even the ones who complain about how deaf the world is.\n\nUnder these circumstances, I decided to revisit her poetry someday. The thing that triggered this series of fortunate events was a review by a friend, which made me want to give Plath s writing another try, because I had sensed many times that she was an author I would certainly love   inexplicable hunches. Therefore, I dived into her only novel, , first published in 1963 under the pseudonym  Victoria Lucas  and under her name in 1967. It tells the story of Esther Greenwood, the young heiress of several of Plath s life experiences.\n\nI dreaded this review; I knew that from this novel would emerge a personal journal barely touching upon the merits of the book. I postponed the process many times since I didn t want to deal with it, the easiest path evoking an infantile self-preservation, considering the world as an enormous rug where one can hide every unpleasant feeling, all the mirrors whose reflections we don t dare to acknowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this novel, I found indecision under the apposite metaphor of a fig tree; undying portions of time where absence is a unilateral reality, and the inability to fit the standards to which a woman is supposed to belong   a perpetual rift between professional development and motherhood. The disparities between the world of a man and the encapsulated universe of a woman in mid-20th-century America. Or any place, any time.\n\nSuch differences constitute a theme that is deeply explored in this book, and from all perspectives, such as work and sexuality.\n\nWhile fighting against her demons, we find in Esther a powerful and perceptive character, full of conviction and harboring a strong yearning for independence, a situation that naturally didn t involve the oppressive presence of a man absorbing her individuality like an unwavering sponge. However, the way her mind worked was much more profound than a trendy dislike composed of empty words. It was a search for identity in a society ruled by men and in which she felt inadequate most of the time. Through the character s reflections, we witness her longing for liberation from the ties of the expected.\n\nIt is certainly striking that this novel, which deals with complex themes under such a stifling atmosphere, could also make me smile. Esther has a unique sense of humor and some of her comments regarding a vast array of things were rather amusing. Under the night that never seemed to end, trying to illuminate the long corridors of her mind, accompanied by voices, electricity and despair, she made me her confident and brought me smiles to pass the time.\n\nis an ambitious work, as I read before, but it s not a perfect novel. There are some fissures that should prevent me from giving it a 5-star rating. Nevertheless, I changed my first rating from four to five stars; it is on my  favorites  shelf, another favorite axe, and it has rekindled my feelings for Plath. I am grateful for the story she shared. And for the fate she forged for her character. Despite the darkness in which this book is immersed, a sense of hope still lingers even after finishing this somber journey. Fig trees are on solid ground, awaiting for courage, a leap of faith, life-changing decisions   meaning, beauty, uniqueness. The silence, a limpid layer which allows to admire the now splendid azure sky, is no longer an ominous sign. As a small stone is thrown into a pond, causing violent ripples that soon vanish while the former serenity is restored, such silence is interrupted briefly by the sound of glass breaking. In the midst of too much consciousness, those small shivers are a vital part of the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 02, 17\n* Also on .\n** Photo credit: Bell jar / via\nFig Tree (ficus)- Masai Mara, Kenya / Elsen Karstad\nBroken window / via karasoft.info\nShow more",

She wins a trip to New York where she encounters an entirely new set of experiences and describes the other women as almost an entirely new species.\n\nEsther is an imperfect character but entirely relatable. She talks about being unsure how and when to tip, describing how the bellhop carried her bag to her room and proceeded to explain about hot and cold water, waiting for a tip.\n\nWhen Esther returns home, she is limited by her economics and the expectations that society has of her gender.

Plath died by suicide a month after its first UK publication.\n\nThe novel was published under Plath's name for the first time in 1967 and was not published in the United States until 1971, in accordance with the wishes of both Plath's husband, Ted Hughes, and her mother. The novel has been translated into nearly a dozen languages. The novel, though dark, is often read in high school English classes.\n\n                         :                             :             (       )                    :                         2006      \n\n     :                                    :             (   )       :                        1352     229                                   1381     230        9646235581          :                           1384     225        9647425295                                                -     20 \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                .....                                                                                        1963                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ... \n\n                                           :          (1960      )                        (1962      )         (1965      )              (1971      )                   (1972      )                 (1981      )  \n\n                   07/08/1399              16/06/1400               .        \nShow more",

From the very beginning, even before her breakdown, I found very little to care for or associate with about Esther. She seemed cynical, disdainful, self-important, and manipulative. I just flat out didn t like her. So when she really began to have some trouble mentally (actually, even before that) I, as a reader, wanted to close the book and get away from her rather than keep reading and see her through it. When I did finish the book, it felt more like a relief than an accomplishment. This is not a story I ever want to revisit. There is much talk of suicide in The Bell Jar and it vividly describes what it can be like to experience a descent into depression. I admire it for what it is but it's just not my cup of tea. It left me feeling gloomy and unsettled.\n\nIn the same vein, I would recommend Girl, Interrupted by Susanna Kaysen. I felt more involved with that one and felt like I learned a good bit about the subject matter.\n\nShow more",

All the girls I had crushes on at the time were reading this book with their pencil skirts and Smiths Tshirts. I read some Plath poetry that I enjoyed but never got to this novel.\n\nI spent a good deal of time reflecting on Esther...the heroine in this modern classic. She is a fascinating study in female narcissism that mistakes herself for being misunderstood, special and superior to men, lesbians and those of other social classes and ethnicities. She is raised by a working class widowed mother whom Esther feels a great deal of disdain and hostility towards. Esther, however, continually struggles for her independence, dealing with her suppressed libido and I suspect significant lesbian tendencies of her own. None of this is unusual in late adolescent females who consider themselves both world weary and special.\n\nUnfortunately Esther suffers also from unprocessed grief, school disappointments and a traumatic event that bring out her biological vulnerability,in her case, either very severe depressive psychosis or more likely a schizoaffective disorder that render her non-functional, at times delusional and severely suicidal.\n\nThis book is her journey from confused spoiled brat to a young woman with a horrendous mental illness and her journey back to the living world. The book is very adept at describing the moral and the social roles of white middle class Northeastern men and women as well as the hypocrisies of that time period. At times the book is hilariously funny despite being about a young woman's immense psychic suffering.\n\nThis book did not reach four star status however. I found much of it fragmented, unfinished and the prose (unlike her poetry) rather pedestrian more than inspired. I also found that although I found the character most fascinating I was not able to empathize or understand to the degree that I had hoped for.\n\nShow more",

A cloud with a silver lining? Possibly. Eventually it s the doubt that remains a constant companion while one is busy gathering shreds of a life which apparently turns into something unexpected, something frail, something blurred, something sour, something like There are no promises to keep and no expectations to be fulfilled except a small desire survives somewhere, a desire wishing for wings of freedom to gather their strength again to soar high in the sky and letting the old brag of heart to leap out and declare in a booming voice   I am, I am, I am.\n\nAnother book, another writer and another winner. I simply loved . I approached it weighing under the burden of my hollow prejudices and expected a story that won t surprise me in any remarkable way but Sylvia Plath! She gave me a valuable gift in the form of this book. I ll probably come across as heavily drenched in my emotions here but it s not every day one finds something which perfectly vocalizes the suppressed whispers of one s past and an immediate present. Another case of deep connection? Not exactly. Just the right amount of shared feelings and a long awaited consolation that I m not the only one.\nNo self-pity or depressing delusions, just plain simple confession which born out of the realization after an official entry into the world. is about Esther Greenwood but I would like to view that name as some sort of anagram which encompasses everyone of us within it, maybe not in its entirety but in bits and parts. In all likelihood, nothing is there in a name and surely I can t speak for everyone else but I know that there s something in the writing style of Sylvia which holds the power of drawing readers in her tale and no matter how much one tries to break free from her words (because they hurt!) it s almost impossible to do so. Esther made me laugh with her honest descriptions of the world and the people around her. She made me her accomplice in her jokes and in her secrets and she made me empathized with her and her plights but at the same time, I was grateful that she was able to share her pain without appearing miserable or demanding any form of solace. She is. She is. She is. That s how I cheered for her.\n\nI uttered 'nothing new  many times while reading it but considering it as a book written 50 years ago which still resonated at such an inexplicable level with me is fascinating to think of. Should I mourn at the repeated instances of histories which repeat themselves or cheer about the knowledge that there lived a girl who had a talent of telling something on behalf of most of us? I m still contemplating about those questions but I guess they ll lose their significance in time to come and only magical essence of Sylvia s words shall remain with me.\n\n\nShow more",

            "content": " It was a queer, sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs, and I didn't know what I was doing in New York. \n\nWhen Esther Greenwood wins an internship at a New York fashion magazine in 1953, she is elated, believing she will finally realise her dream to become a writer. But in between the cocktail parties and piles of manuscripts, Esther's life begins to slide out of control. She finds herself spiralling into depression and eventually a suicide attempt, as she grapples with difficult relationships and a society which refuses to take women's aspirations seriously.\n\nWhere do I even begin to review this magnificent book. I feel it has come to me at a point in my life that I needed it most. We follow the life of young Esther who at a certain point in the narrative ends up going into a deep depression and is admitted to a psychiatric clinic. Plath herself had attempted suicide in 1952. It is because of this combination of autobiographical references, the topic of depression and the author's ability and sensitivity to express what she was going through that make this one of the most beautiful, complex, sensitive, deep, dense books, sad and hard to read.\n\nEsther Greenwood, our fictional protagonist, is unfortunately only a veiled cover for Plath s real world disease which reached its nadir in 1963 when she took her own life at the young age of thirty.\n\nPlath s prose is incredibly beautiful. If you did not already know, you can tell with ease that this writing is very personal. As much as it was meant to be shared, it also seems like a form of release. Plath deals with the anxieties of adulthood, the female psyche, and the grotesque reality of psychiatric treatments against a 50s backdrop. Themes like this are heavy. They linger. This is what makes The Bell Jar such a success. This is how the book manages to find a place between our hands, hearts, and heads.\n\nWhat it has to say about what women expect of themselves, and what society expects of women, is as sharply relevant today as it has always been.\n\nIt's not a book for everyone, it's not for anytime, but at the same time it's a book for everyone and for life.\n\nShow more",

            "content": "Based on Plath's own experience of breakdown in college, The Bell Jar charts the deterioration of protagonist Esther Greenwood's mental stability while interning for a fast-paced fashion magazine one summer in New York City. The first-person retrospective narration juxtaposes ironic detachment and impassioned lyricism: Esther swings from cooly assessing the insurmountable adversity she faces as a woman living in a sexist society to recounting the fits of existential despair she suffered the year she lost control over her life. The narrative is tightly structured, the descriptions moving, the characterization nuanced. Considering that the novel is a first-rate work of art with an ambiguous ending, it seems important to approach on its own terms with detailed attention to its history and form, not its author's act of suicide. Autobiographical as the story is, the book's much more than an unself-aware reflection of Plath's life or an ominous foreshadowing of her death. To overlook the work's artifice or its fictionality not only does a disservice to Plath as an artist but also perpetuates the reductive views about the work of women (writers) that in part prompted Plath to write the novel in the first place.\nShow more",

            "content": "I'm really struggling with writing a review for this one, given the unique nature of the book and the sad reality that surrounds it. Every book is a testament of its author in one way or another, but with this semi-fictional autobiography it's difficult not to equate the book with its tragic author, making the reviewing of it an exercise in the kind of delicacy I'm not very well versed in. A delicacy that, frankly, I don't really enjoy employing.\n\nSo what is one to do when he didn't really like \"\"? Tread very carefully through the thorny bushes, knowing many in the Goodreads populace have a special place in their heart for this sensitive book. I decided on a respectful three-star rating even though my less delicate self would probably give it only two. It gets three because of its importance, because of its needing to be heard, but my heart of hearts doesn't care all that much about importance. It cares about being lifted up while this story mainly seemed to try and drag it down.\n\nI called this book an \"autobiography\", but with the important difference that autobiographies put the emphasis on a life fully lived, while in this book life seems pretty empty and the story was mostly about reasons for and ways of ending it. This book reads very much like a cry for help, and cries for help don't generally make for pleasant reading. The fact I felt useless as I heard that cry, the dread that comes with seeing a person consumed by fires I can't put out and other such merry sentiments make it hard for me to say I enjoyed this book. Everybody who reads this classic also knows about the tragic fate of the author, making the cry for help all the more chilling and making it akin to the reading of an elaborate suicide note. In short: I'd be surprised if this makes it on any \"best beach reads\" lists. I realise that even if this isn't a pleasant read that doesn't mean that it's not a good read, or a meaningful one, so let me elaborate on my mediocre rating for a book so highly praised by many others.\n\nI normally don't go for books dealing with depression, telling of a darkness with which I'm unfamiliar and quite uncomfortable, but reading is also about getting outside of your comfort zone. Also, I've got a severe gender inequality problem going on in my 2016 reading list and this book, hailed as an important womanly novel, caught my attention through promises of profundity and humor. The profound is there, in the intentions of the author to tell this deeply personal story, but I found most of the observations made in the book surprisingly superficial. The humor, while there in the earlier parts, felt like vinegar to a thirsty mouth. A perfectly enjoyable riff on the tipping system in New York in one of the earlier chapters gets a bitter taste by the end of the book, becoming a denouncement of one of the many things that are wrong with this world.\n\nDespite the lack of living up to what was promised, not all was bad with this book. Plath had the gift of prose, with elegant metaphors and the creation of immersive settings, evoking indelible images like of Esther sitting in the breezeway trying to write a book or a pair of boots pointing to the ocean. She's got a poetic stroke that mixes very well with her cynical side, resulting in a reading experience that was artistically and aesthetically pleasing. It's sad that this first novel is also her last, because the markings of true talents, with a lot of potential to be further developed, were clearly visible.\n\nI'm sad for Sylvia Plath and for everyone who shared and shares her plight. I have a great yet tender respect for her, writing this book, which must have cost her a tremendous effort given all the dark clouds in her heavy mind, trapped under a bell jar. But it was not for nothing, because as she was heaving up the bell jar with every word she wrote, trudging along with it in order to be heard, she created something that would make her message heard, then, now and far into the future. Go on, Sylvia Plath, and rest in peace. Your bell will keep resounding, maybe not on sunlit beaches, but definitely in your readers' hearts.\n\nShow more",

It has always stood apart in Literature because of the way it closely mirrored the author's experiences.\n\nKnowing that the novel was published in 1971 I was puzzled to find that the prevailing attitudes, culture and mores seemed to date from an earlier time - at least a decade earlier. The main character, Esther, feels suffocated not only by her own feelings of inadequacy and incipient paranoia, but also by the crushingly mundane life she as a female would be expected to follow. Starting off as an intern on a fashion magazine was possibly one of the worst choices she could make, but at this time there were few realistic options.\n\n1950's, I thought, rather than late 60's?

It opens with \"the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs,\" as if it were an omen of what is to come. Conspicuous and beautiful, it tells a story of despair as a young woman falls to the pitfalls of depression.\n The trouble was, I had been inadequate all along, I simply hadn't thought about it. \n's death haunts every page as depair vanquishes life. Was there ever hope for Esther/Sylvia? Perhaps... However, helplessness and doubts drifts all over as a constant companion while she tries to hold to shreds of her life.\nSo, there remains a small desire to survive, a desire for freedom to gather strength again to sail with the wind and fly away. And, fragments of realization that we are not alone in our despair.\n\nwith her superb, alluring and somber writing, holds the reader spellbound and has the power of drawing us into her tale. Her words may hurt, it s almost impossible not to do so. But Esther/Sylvia also made me laugh with her honest descriptions of the world and the people around her. She made me her accomplice in her hilaraty, in her secrets and in her honesty. Thus, the reader empathizes and is grateful to share with her her pain without appearing miserable or demanding any form of solace.\n\nThe beauty of , packed with bleak truths, difficult topics and wryly dark humor surprises and teaches us that our sorrows are simply us being human. This uncovering, if nothing else, should make us grateful.\n___\nShow more",

            "content": " I tried to smile, but my skin had gone stiff, like parchment.\n\nThen something bent down and took hold of me and shook me like the end of the world. Whee-ee-ee-ee-ee, it shrilled, through an air crackling with blue light, and with each flash a great jolt drubbed me till I thought my bones would break and the sap fly out of me like a split plant.\n\nI wondered what terrible thing it was that I had done. \n\nThis reminds me of this guy that used to go around the country talking about that moment in time when he hung in the air after jumping from the Golden Gate Bridge. He knew instantly that he d made a terrible mistake and at that moment desperately wanted to live. When I worked in San Francisco and lived in Richmond, I would sometimes take the Golden Gate Bridge to work and the Bay Bridge on the way back home, to mix things up, or vice versa. Sometimes the traffic report would push me one way or another. After being trapped for three hours waiting for a jumper on Golden Gate to decide if he was really going to do it or finally climb back down, I became paranoid as to whether there would be a jumper every time I climbed into my Jeep to head home.\n\nI can remember people standing in groups, cupping their hands around their mouths, yelling for the man to jump. It was the indecision that was so inconvenient. I have to admit, even though it made my stomach sour, that I too wanted a resolution to this interruption in my life. I wanted to be home with my family, a good book, and a glass of wine. We are all capable of such selfish thoughts.\n\nI felt the same way at moments in this book. I thought to myself,...Just please get it over with. I can t take this anymore. How could I possibly think that the loss of a few hours of my life was worth all the rest of someone else s life? Of course, I don t believe that when it is put in those stark of terms, but the wait for something to happen was/is nauseating as well.\n\nSo Esther Greenwood has earned a scholarship to college. She is certainly smart and has come up with a snappy subject for her dissertation, if only she could get around to actually reading . She has a roommate, Doreen, whom she admires immensely. She seems so self-possessed and free from the burdens of expectations. Esther is pretty enough, not the prettiest of girls, but pretty enough to attract the attention of boys, but of course, men prefer Doreen.\nThere is that aura around Doreen that makes men want to break through that cool exterior to the tiger they can sense lurks beneath.\n\nThere are hundreds of girls who would be jealous of Esther s opportunities, but Esther will gladly trade her life for almost any life. The problem is, there is no escape from herself. There is a voice that is slowly turning all the rest of the natives in her head against her.\n\nIf only Esther can jump from a bridge and fall far enough, before hitting a safety net, to discover that suicide is not what she wants.\n\n\n\nOf course, the poignancy of reading is the fact that Sylvia Plath does attempt to kill herself in 1953 in a similar way as Esther does in the book. This may be a novel, but the autobiographical elements of the book make it as real as reading a memoir or Plath s diary. The tragedy is, of course, that Sylvia, ten years later, does successfully end her own life, so I guess we know the ending of Esther s life as well.\n\nI kept wishing that Esther/Sylvia would work as diligently at finding a reason to live as she did scheming for a way to kill herself. I kept thinking about Anthony Bourdain, Virginia Woolf, and in particular David Foster Wallace; all had many people who admired them and loved them. We think one of the worst things on this planet is to be unloved and how being in that terrifying position would be a reason to be suicidal, but these chemical imbalances that people suffer from tilt the scales of their lives in the wrong direction. It doesn t matter how much they are loved. I want to unroll the list of things Bourdian has loved and read them to him one by one to convince him that he has much to live for. I want to catch Woolf at the river, pull the rocks from her dress pockets and fling them into the water to sink without her. I want to cut the rope that is dangling from the rafters of Wallace s house and watch him inhale that first precious gasp of air. I want to walk into Plath s house in 1963 and turn off the gas and carry her out into the sunlight.\n\nIs that what they wanted? A miraculous intervention? Did they want the universe to insist that they live?\n\nThis book is considered by many to be a masterpiece. The book is certainly unsettling, especially when the reader knows he is basically reading a 234 page suicide note. Wallace, I believe, wrote two pages. Woolf wrote a simple page, but a beautiful one. It is unclear whether Bourdain wrote a suicide note, but given his penchant for prose, I find it hard to believe that he didn t. I can see how people who are struggling, especially those who are struggling silently, with their mental health would seek this book out. It does seem to help once people know they are not alone or even discover that their problems are not unusual. Does this book help or hinder someone s own recovery? I don t know the answer to that.\n\nI do think those people who have someone in their life who is grappling with mental health issues would possibly gain some insight into their loved one s battle with their own mind by reading this book. For those who see the very best in life, it is sometimes difficult to understand why someone would want to kill themselves. When I feel a bit blue, there is always a book to pull from a shelf to take me somewhere else long enough to let the stormy weather in my mind subside. I feel very fortunate that I have discovered such an outlet for my happiness.\n\nThe victim is not the only victim; suicides leave a lake of tears and recriminations in their wake.\n\nIf you are suffering and are contemplating suicide, please do continue to search for a reason to live. There is something out there for you. Don t be dangling in the air before you realize that you really do want to live.\n\nIf you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit I also have a Facebook blogger page at: and an Instagram account\nShow more",

If you've lived with or are fond of someone followed by the Black Dog, this describes the intensity of the feelings (and the treatment) well.\n\nCountless critics and reviewers have written about this sad 'memoir' (written as fiction and first published under a pseudonym) about depression, but it is also full of funny anecdotes and perfect insight into American East Coast college girls in the 1950s.\n\nKnowing that it s autobiographical makes it more painful than usual to watch someone curl up in despair, feeling as if she s been captured under a bell jar, suffocating. Being exceptionally smart, talented, popular and loved is no preventive against depression.\n\nShe is driven to write, and when she isn t driven, she fears she ll never get that feeling again. Therapy, asylums, shock treatment, you name it, it's done to her.\n\nI ve not read Plath s poems, for which she is much lauded, but I liked the one that was included. I can t help wondering if she d lived a generation or two later if she d have found anything that would have helped her better.\n\nInterestingly, to me, are the mentions of feeling some comfort being in a tiny crawl space or wedged between her mattress and the padded headboard.\n\n\n\nThis is reminiscent of Temple Grandin s and the similar weights and aids that are used with people on the autism spectrum who may not tolerate real hugs but who crave the relief that pressure can give. There s now a lot of information about these, but there wasn t back then. Rooms with no windows feel safe to her, too.\n\nHer alter-ego is Esther, and this scene is when she had a month s internship at the popular magazine. She s gone there, thinking she s always wanted to go to graduate school or study in Europe, become a professor and write. But when her boss calls her in and asks her point blank what she wants to do, Esther is astonished to hear herself reply:\n\n\n\nThis sort of thing that we might do ourselves and wonder idly about, has really thrown her. The fact that she gave as an example is interesting, in that, her father died when she was very young, and she mentions later that she was never really happy after that. So for her to even contemplate as an example the idea of his being a sham tells us how startling she found her impulsive answer:\n\nBut there are so many funny anecdotes, that it s not all heavy-going. She drank all the water (including the blossoms) in the first fingerbowl she ever saw (at a wealthy benefactor s, who kindly didn t remark on it), and found out only later when a college debutante told her. She dates, teases, goes to parties, joins in plenty of college-aged antics.\n\nHer sarcasm and cynicism come through in comments such as this, when she and her med-student boyfriend are outside a delivery room, hearing a woman in labour making a lot of noise. He tells her that the woman is on a drug that will make her forget all about the pain because she   s in a kind of twilight sleep.\n\nEsther thinks:\n\n\nShe wants to grow up, become an adult, lose her virginity, become one of but remain outside of , whoever are. The popular crowd. She actually did a pretty good job of straddling the divide, I think, but that may have been part of her undoing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere s an enormous amount of information available about Plath and her work, as there is about Temple Grandin and hers, although they are very different women. Still, I sense some connection there.\n\nI enjoyed the writing and have only a bit of criticism about the loose ends that I think she was unable to tie up and that we may think we have figured out, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nI'm sorry she didn't find, as the women in labour were supposed to find, an escape from feeling that a\n\nMy edition had a lengthy editor s note at the end with some sketches and a biographical note by .\n\nFascinating.\n\nP.S. See comment #25 for my response to another reader who hated the book because they were triggered by the racism and language, especially the use of the \"n -word\" (not the usual \"n-word\", but \"Negro\"), which IS what we were taught was the appropriate language in the 1950s.\n\nWritten in , this is the \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail\" by addressing his fellow clergymen about his work. In it he uses the word 'Negro' 64 times and the word 'black' only 5 times and when talking about 'black nationalists'.\nShow more",

            "content": "Man has no foothold that is not also a bargain. So be it!\n\n-Djuna Barnes, Nightwood\nI ve been side-eyeing this book for a very long time, much as I warily circle any piece of work whose chosen topics happen to lie close to deeply personal experiences of mine. It s difficult to tell what I fear more from these bundles of paper and ink. The chance of severe disappointment? The possibility of debilitating resonance? Either one would weigh much too heavily on my sensibilities and result in time lost to regaining equilibrium.\n\nNot that I grate against having to go through such measures to regain normal functioning in society, mind you. The fact that I have found such measures is a matter that I treasure greatly. It s just that I would prefer to be careful with the reading material from the start, a methodology which helps me funnel the eventual after-effects into something rewarding with a quick recovery time. This review, for example.\n\nWhat I found in this book was not what I had been expecting. I didn t even like it at first, the flat and formless prose bleating mundanities and rarely breaking out into the creative bents of lurid glory that I had assumed would compose the entirety. My opinion changed as I went on, as it often does, and I have come to see this straightforward dropping of facts and opinions as a boon, a mark of brilliance almost when it comes to presenting content such as this.\n\nFor mental illness continues to have a horrid stigma in this society of ours, and it was a mere few years ago that one of my friends was forcefully taken away from a dorm room by a cop to a  psychiatric boot camp , which lasted for a week and ended with her furious and shaken and landed with a bill for $8,000. All for having mentioned to her university granted and 'confidential' therapist that she had considered killing herself. As she discussed the events leading up to it, I saw the similarities between her thoughts and mine, and thought about how easily I could have found myself in the same horrible situation.\n\nI didn t realize it then, but this event would play a major role in my eventual dropping out of college, as well as propel me on my way to find my own method of coping with life. For I am defiantly stubborn when it comes to justifying my existence, and refuse to let anyone or anything force me on a path of  fixing  me. In choosing that, I have been much more fortunate than Esther Greenwood, as I have had the time and the space to come to conclusions about my own particular brand of troubles as a female bred for academic success, and how to best deal with them. How life is full of countless little dissatisfactions, and how the mind is so wonderful at subconsciously accumulating each and every one, and how splintered it can become when it is led to believe that happiness is found one way, and then another, as it is betrayed again, and again, and again. How practical one can be in the face of all this, right alongside the absurd choices that rail against every measure of  practicality  defined by everyone and everything around you that simply aren t all they re cracked up to be.\nIt is all too easy to think oneself into a box of  if I just did this everything would be alright  and  why can t I do all this like everyone else is  and  oh I can t do that because it costs money/wastes time/breaks off the path that is supposed to work for all . It is all too easy to subconsciously realize how all these  proper  pathways have failed and have led to the simple urge to end it all, when one can see all too clearly how any effort to prolong anything 'proper' is destined for failure. The hard part is figuring out exactly what want and need. The frontier of the unknown is whether you will be given the means to achieve it.\n\nI promised myself a long time ago that when it came to choosing whether to go back to the path that was guaranteed to end in me jumping off a bridge, or to live, I would choose the latter. Every single time. It s required breaking off a lot of social connections, it s required sitting down on random sidewalk curbs filled with busy pedestrians until I ve finished my latest piece of writing, it s required bursting into tears while reading in the middle of a university library because I could see so clearly that the only chance for happiness I had was nowhere on the path that I had been and was expected to lead my whole life on. It s required a lot of banal events of the same flavor as the ones described in this book, and it s ultimately required a lot of nonsensical shit that would have landed me in that  psychiatric boot camp  many times over, much of which I can recognize within these pages. And while the events described in this book happened long ago, the attitude towards mental illness today is still one of distrustful hysterics, and I'll be damned if I put my faith in the impositions of the public before I've exhausted every possibility within my own voluntary grasp.\n\nYou know what? I will never be  fixed , so long as I choose to live. Each day has a chance of containing small wonders, small horrors, small acts of weirdness that keep me going and really don t oppress anyone or anything else, so long as no one thinks themselves capable of interfering  for my own good  without my completely informed permission. There will be no final day where I find myself capable of living like  normal  people. But so long as I can see a future that compels me on, a future that adheres much more to my own sense of worth than what society and its denizens would like me to believe, I can keep going.\n\nTo me, that s all that really matters. And I am grateful to this book for giving me the chance to express it.\nShow more",

        "bio": "Emily Jane Bront  was an English novelist and poet, now best remembered for her only novel Wuthering Heights, a classic of English literature. Emily was the second eldest of the three surviving Bront  sisters, being younger than Charlotte Bront  and older than Anne Bront . She published under the masculine pen name Ellis Bell.\n\nEmily was born in Thornton, near Bradford in Yorkshire to Patrick Bront  and Maria Branwell. She was the younger sister of Charlotte Bront  and the fifth of six children. In 1824, the family moved to Haworth, where Emily's father was perpetual curate, and it was in these surroundings that their literary oddities flourished. In childhood, after the death of their mother, the three sisters and their brother Patrick Branwell Bront  created imaginary lands (Angria, Gondal, Gaaldine, Oceania), which were featured in stories they wrote. Little of Emily's work from this period survived, except for poems spoken by characters (The Bront s' Web of Childhood, Fannie Ratchford, 1941).\n\nIn 1842, Emily commenced work as a governess at Miss Patchett's Ladies Academy at Law Hill School, near Halifax, leaving after about six months due to homesickness. Later, with her sister Charlotte, she attended a private school in Brussels. They later tried to open up a school at their home, but had no pupils.\n\nIt was the discovery of Emily's poetic talent by Charlotte that led her and her sisters, Charlotte and Anne, to publish a joint collection of their poetry in 1846, Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell. To evade contemporary prejudice against female writers, the Bront  sisters adopted androgynous first names. All three retained the first letter of their first names: Charlotte became Currer Bell, Anne became Acton Bell, and Emily became Ellis Bell. In 1847, she published her only novel, Wuthering Heights, as two volumes of a three volume set (the last volume being Agnes Grey by her sister Anne). Its innovative structure somewhat puzzled critics. Although it received mixed reviews when it first came out, the book subsequently became an English literary classic. In 1850, Charlotte edited and published Wuthering Heights as a stand-alone novel and under Emily's real name.\n\nLike her sisters, Emily's health had been weakened by the harsh local climate at home and at school. She caught a chill during the funeral of her brother in September, and, having refused all medical help, died on December 19, 1848 of tuberculosis, possibly caught from nursing her brother. She was interred in the Church of St. Michael and All Angels family capsule, Haworth, West Yorkshire, England."

            "content": "I'm just on fire with so much admiration for Emily Bront  right now. Having read this book, I now understand why it s generated such fierce controversy since its first publication in 1847. Why early reviews dismissed it as an aberration (with one pearl-clutching reviewer wondering  how a human being could have attempted such a book as the present without committing suicide before he had finished a dozen chapters ) and why writers like Sylvia Plath and E.M. Forster, drawn to the complex and often contradictory open vein of the novel, went out of their way to reject such easy classifications.\n\nThis review is, in many ways, my attempt to understand how continues to enable many difficult and contradictory stances even today, entrenching its legacy as one of the most dynamic and generative novels of the 19th century.\n\nThe first element that makes so interesting is . The novel is presented as a series of second even third hand accounts, a story rehearsed and sanitized by multiple re-enactors with the reader being the last in a succession of interpreters. In other words, the story changes hands multiple times, often between hostile and uncomprehending narrators, before it makes its way to the reader. This structure is nuanced in multiple ways; it is also tricky, for it depends entirely on the reader s willingness to turn to Nelly the central narrator for an authoritative interpretation of the story. Nelly, however, is not a very sympathetic narrator, and her thinly veiled bias against (or for) the characters brings into question the validity of her account. We are forced into awareness, again and again, of the flawed nature of Nelly's interpretations and of the uncrossable distances that lie between what we are reading and what the story is. It is precisely this awareness which challenges us to take nothing at face value and demands our in the process of meaning-making.\n\nTo put it differently: faced with the possibility of the novel as the culmination of a flawed even  interpretation, one can only read with a kind of , with the desire to get close to something inconsolable, just beyond reach. Therein lies, the novel says, the potential for true understanding: in the underground currents of emotion, the not-easily-reached places far beneath the surface of what the reader can see and understand. It is this frame of reference however flawed, failed, or imperfect that gives the characters a context in which we can begin to accept, understand, and grapple for their ultimate depths.\n\nThis brings us to the second element which makes such productive fodder for interpretation: . In a story that is told at one, two, sometimes removes, Bront  s characters are not at all remote. Bront  brings a depth of anguish to the characters and engages our compassion no matter how unflattering and biased the gaze through which we see them. This is nowhere as gorgeously epitomized as in the characters of Heathcliff and Catherine, with whom lays the broken heart of .\n\nHeathcliff s vehemence, his grief and naked want, Catherine s selfishness, her strain and struggle against the confines of her life these things are rendered so honestly and so rawly in a way that appealed to me despite, sometimes , their deep abiding wrongness. is not just a story about a  toxic  romantic attachment between two deeply broken and detestable characters. In fact, to argue the degree to which Heathcliff and Catherine s relationship was  toxic  or  problematic  seems less relevant to me than the incontrovertible fact that in a world that would not let them be whole, . To me, this is where the simple truth of lies: in Catherine and Heathcliff's longing to be recognized by each other in a way that defies and transcends  separation,  and in the subsequent void and loss they suffer when one is intolerably deprived of the other.\n\nreturns over and over to this theme of identity through the other, the desire to be defined in terms of an  existence  beyond  our  contained  selves. For Catherine and Heathcliff, their very sense of  self  was sustained through the bond of devotion they forged between them in childhood, back when they were flashing with youth and magic and hunger, and their passion for each other has always illuminated the gap between who they longed to be, and who they actually were. Invoking Heathcliff, Catherine confesses to Nelly at one point that  He's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same.  In this way, is so truthful about what it means to be human: to desire to be known by another as intimately, as completely, as one knows their own image in a mirror, to love and despise and long for and tire of each other because it is a much merciful fate than a lifetime of emptiness, silence, and absence.\n\nUnder this light, it is easy to understand Heathcliff s and Catherine s unraveling, and in understanding, to love and pity them. We understand that in losing Heathcliff, Catherine lost her life, and in losing her, Heathcliff lost himself. All the proofs of passion, all the crawling devotions that sustained him in youth have yielded to nothingness, and somewhere inside Heathcliff a dam has broken, with nothing in its stead to stave off the madness of being alone, or to ward off the unpurged ghosts of a brutal past.\n\nThrough Heathcliff s unraveling, Bront  lays a carefully layered, generational look at the reverberating effects of trauma and what it costs to give others so much power over us. Raised with the stigma of illegitimacy and of deviancy (and potentially of , but that s an essay for another day), and subjected to a childhood of casual abuse, name-calling and cruelty, Heathcliff spends the years following Catherine s death trying to his traumatic past, his experiences of degradation and loss, in others. Heathcliff, ultimately, does not just preserve the memory of Catherine, which he feels bound to, but rather transform it into something else, into .\n\nIt is impossible not to feel at once entranced and horrified and rocked by the horror of what Heathcliff becomes, not to ache with sympathy for a younger version of Heathcliff. But I found myself hurting more for Cathy, Hareton, and Linton, and the complex, many-generationed hatreds that twisted between them. paints one of the portraits of generational trauma that I ve ever read. Bront 's use of intimate domestic spaces as prison, her disfiguring of family into a site for violence, evil, and struggle, and her deliberate re-creation of past trauma in the second generation is masterful. The result is a novel that understands so thoroughly, so completely, and with bone-deep care that the scars inflicted by childhood abuse, by trauma, by the generational inheritance of atrocious memory, do not just fade away; they stay and linger and fester .\n\nThat was conceived and published before the advent of psychology is absolutely wild to me. The novel is a profoundly haunting experience of a book, one that I am sure will dog my thoughts for a very, very long time.\nShow more",

            "content": "This is my favourite book. I do not say that lightly - I've read quite a lot from all different genres - but this is my favourite book. Of all time. Ever. The ladies over at The Readventurer kindly allowed me to get my feelings of utter adoration for Wuthering Heights off my chest in their \"Year of the Classics\" feature, but I now realise it's time I posted a little something in this blank review space. I mean, come on, it's my favourite book so it deserves better than empty nothingness.\n\nSo, what do I love so much about ? . Okay, maybe not. That wouldn't really be saying it strongly enough.\n\nWhat I love about this novel is the setting; the wilderness. This is not a story about niceties and upper class propriety. This is the tale of people who aren't so socially acceptable, who live away from the strict rules of civilization - it's almost as if they're not quite from the world we know. The isolation of the setting out on the Yorkshire moors between the fictional dwellings of The Heights and Thrushcross Grange emphasises how far removed these characters are from social norms, how unconventional they are, and how lonely they are.\n\nThis is a novel for readers who can appreciate unlikeable characters; readers who don't have to like someone to achieve a certain level of understanding of them and their circumstances. People are not born evil... so what makes them that way? What torments a man so much that he refuses to believe he has any worth? What kind of person digs up the grave of their loved one so they can see them once again? Heathcliff was not created to be liked or to earn your forgiveness. simply tells his story from the abusive and unloved childhood he endured, to his obsession with the only person alive who showed him any real kindness, to his adulthood as an angry, violent man who beats his wife and imprisons the younger Cathy in order to make her marry his son.\n\nIt would be so easy to hate Heathcliff, and I don't feel that he is some dark, sexy hero like others often do. But I appreciate what attempts to teach us about the cycle of violence and aggression. Heathcliff eventually becomes little more than the man he hates. By being brought up with beatings and anger he in turn unleashes it on everyone else. And Cathy is no delicate flower either. What hope did Heathcliff have when the only person he ever loved was so selfish and vindictive? But I love for creating such imperfect, screwed-up characters.\n\nThis is a dark novel that deals with some very complicated people, but I think in the end we are offered the possibility of peace and happiness through Cathy (younger) and Hareton's relationship, and the suggestion that Cathy (older) and Heathcliff were reunited in the afterlife. I had an English teacher in high school that said Cathy and Heathcliff's personalities and their relationship were too much for this world and that peace was only possible for them in the next. I have no idea if this was something Ms Bronte intended, but the romantic in me likes to imagine that it's true.\n\n| | | |\nShow more",

            "content": "I understand why many people hate this book. Catherine and Heathcliff are monstrous. Monstrous. You won't like them because they are unlikable. They are irrational, self-absorbed, malicious and pretty much any negative quality you can think a person is capable of possessing without imploding. They seek and destroy and act with no thought to consequence. And I find it fascinating that Emily Bronte chose them to be her central protagonists.\n\nWhen this was first published it was met with animosity because of how utterly repugnant these two characters were. The way they go about their business caring nothing for others but themselves was enough for me to shake my head in complete and total judgment, as if Catherine and Heathcliff could see me and are then effectively shamed by their actions.\n\nis epic, in my humble opinion, because I believe that the scope of this story is monumental. Let me explain: it is a simple tale between two families that are bound in such a way that their fates are irrevocably linked. What affects one, affects the other. Its about Catherine and Heathcliff who fall in love and how their relationship ruins the lives of those around them. The book, all 400 pages of it, occur almost entirely at Wuthering Heights, the estate of the Earnshaws, and at Thrushcross Grange, the estate of the Lintons with only a couple of miles of land in between.\n\nAnd yet it is not a small story.\n\nThe emotional magnitude of this book is great and far reaching. The provoking and unapologetic quality of Bronte's writing is seductive. The process of reading this story can feel so masochistic sometimes that its almost if she's daring us to stop reading and throw the book away. Like its a game of personal endurance to see how much we can take, how far we can go. She pushes at us, challenging us and all the while knowing that we have to keep reading because redemption awaits. It is like its contemporaries.\n\nThe moors, the darkness of the moors, that curses the household of Wuthering Heights and its inhabitants is ever present. Nature is personified. It is its own character; its there, lingering and simmering ever so quietly, saturating every scene with its silent threats of doom...okay, I have to stop talking like this...what am I anymore?\n\nThere is poison in this book, but let me ease your mind by saying that it is balanced with goodness also. This isn't a perfect novel. There were still moments I found myself in perplexion (recently invented word). And while everything about Catherine and Heathcliff may be corrupt, there is hope in . If you can journey through the menacing forest of Emily Bronte's imagination, do it because the view is something to behold.\n\nHa ha ha, this review...what even is this?\nShow more",

            "content": "I never expected this book to be as flagrantly, unforgivably bad as it was.\n\nTo start, Bronte's technical choice of narrating the story of the primary characters by having the housekeeper explain everything to a tenant 20 years after it happened completely kills suspense and intimacy. The most I can say is that to some extent this functions as a device to help shroud the story and motives from the reader. But really, at the time literary technique hadn't quite always gotten around to accepting that omnipotent 3rd person narrators are allowed, so you'd have to have a multiperspective story told by an omnipotent 3rd person narrator who was actually a character in the story (e.g. the housekeeper Ellen). The layers of perspective make it annoying and sometimes impossible to figure out who is telling what bit of story; and moreover, because so much is related as two characters explaining things between themselves, the result is that we rarely see any action, and instead have the entire book explained in socratic, pedantic exposition.\n\nThe sense of place is poorly rendered and almost entirely missing. Great, the moor is gray.\n\nBut ultimately, the most damning thing is that the characters are a bunch of immature, insuffrable, narcissistic assholes with very little self respect. This isn't a story of great love and passion. It's the story of how child abuse perpetuates itself through the generations. The characters are either emotionally abused as children or, as in the case of Cathy I, they're spoiled and overindulged with no discipline and can't muster the restraint and self-respect to ditch abusive relationships. I kept waiting for any of the characters to be remotely worth my time, but I found no respite from the brutish abuse of the horribly twisted Heathcliff or from the simpering idiocy of Cathy I and II. Ugh. Not only are there no transformations or growth, but the characters aren't even that likable to begin with. How this book got to be a classic is beyond me.\nShow more",

            "content": "Certain novels come to you with pre-packaged expectations. They just seem to be part of literature's collective unconscious, even if they are completely outside of your own cultural referents. I, for instance, who have no particular knowledge of--or great love for--romantic, Anglo-Gothic fiction, came to Wuthering Heights with the assumption that I was picking up a melancholy ghost story of thwarted, passionate love and eternal obsession. Obsession turned out to be only accurate part of this presumption.\n\nHaving an image of Heathcliff and Cathy embracing -style on a windy moor ironed in my mind, I was almost completely unprepared for the hermetic, moribund, bleak, vengeful, perverse, and yes--obsessive--novel that this really is. is not about windmills and is not really a love story. Heathcliff and Cathy's love affair (if it can be called that) is a narcissistic (\"I am Heathcliff!\" Cathy exclaims at one point), possessive, and imminently cruel relationship predicated on self-denial and an obsessiveness that relies not on passion, but rather borders on hatred. They are selfish, violent, and contriving people who have borne their fair share of abuses (mostly Heathcliff in this respect) and in turn, feel no compunction about raining similar abuses on those who they find beneath them.\n\nGiven this dynamic, it seems perhaps inevitable that these two characters would make not only themselves miserable, but everyone around them miserable--even after death. This is particularly easy to accomplish mainly because there are--with the exception of Mr. Lockwood, the tenant who rents a home from Heathcliff--no outside characters. Everyone in the novel (including the servants) is isolated, trapped between the same two homes, with the same two families, and have truly no chance of escaping any of the events and repercussions that occur.(One character makes a temporary escape, only to suffer all the more for it later.)\n\nMore important, however, is the fact that Heathcliff and Cathy don't even need be present (although they usually are in some fashion) for their influences to be felt by the other characters. The sins of the father, are literally, inherited and distributed among the next generation. The children of are not only physical doubles of their parents (At least 3 characters look like Cathy, and one resembles Heathcliff), but they are also spiritual stand-ins. They must suffer for past transgressions, and they must find a way to make amends for them. All, I might add, without the particular benefit of ever having the full story, the context that might be necessary to actually change their circumstances. Misery, it seems, is inevitable.\n\nThere is, of course, much more to be said about this novel. One could spend quite some time dissecting all the various repetitions and doublings, the narrative structure (the story is told by the housekeeper to the lodger who then writes it down as a diary entry), or the archetypal analogies and semi-biblical symbolism that seems to be implicit to every part of this story.\n\nThe point being, I suppose, that while may not be the wistful romance one (or maybe just I) expected to be, it is a particularly satisfying one for all of its dark and layered surprises.\nShow more",

(I am saying there are two wolves in order to reference the meme, but what would be more accurate is to say that inside of me there are two boring and nonviolent creatures. Like a pigeon.

            "content": "This is a review I never imagined I d write. This is a book I was convinced I d love. I just have to face the facts, Emily is no Charlotte.\n\nI m going to start with the positives. The characterisation of Heathcliff is incredibly strong. He is a man who is utterly tormented by the world. As a gypsy boy he is dark skinned and dark haired, and to the English this rough, almost wild, look makes him a ruffian. He stands up for himself, and bites back; thus, he is termed a monster. In a very, very, Frankenstein s monster like sense, his perceived outer image begins to permeate his soul. Call a man a monster, and eventually he may start acting like one.\n\n\n\nHe is a very complex man, capable of great cruelty and kindness. The world has made him bitter, and in a way ruined him. He reaps revenge, but revenge always ends the same way; it doesn t solve problems but creates more. So he becomes even more tormented, this time by his own actions. He is very Byronic, and by today s standards a little bit of a bad boy. He has all the standard tropes of an anti-hero, one that becomes a figure that can be sympathised with and hated. He s a very complex man.\n\nThe Bronte s were directly affected by Byron s poetry. Rochester is Charlotte s portrayal of a similar, albeit less vengeful, character. Love is the key torment in both works. Heathcliff has been rejected, as Rochester cannot open his heart because of his secret wife. But, rather that overcome his personal loss, and subject the world to his dark and broody personality, Heathcliff actually seeks to do others harm. He is a very sensitive man when it comes to his own emotions, though he lacks any real empathy. He does not care that he is creating more pain for others. He spends his life spreading more hate into the world. His only redeeming quality is his love for Catherine, but that doesn t excuse his tyranny. He knows how nasty he is:\n\n\n\nHe's so self-centred:\n\n\n\nSo I rather like his character, well not like but appreciate the complexity, though the novel s structure itself was abysmal. I have quite a few problems with the narrative.\n\nWhy is a servant telling us this story as she speaks to a visitor of her master s house? Why are we hearing someone s interpretation of the events rather than the events themselves? Why is it twenty years later in the form of an extremely long conversation? Why is the servant still actually working for Heathcliff? She would have left. Nobody would choose to work for such a man. It just doesn t make a lot of sense. At times it felt like the credibility of the story was stretched to breaking point. Nelly (the servant) actually being in some of the scenes was almost laughable. Often it was followed by a terrible explanation attempting to justify her presence. It sounded very desperate to me.\n\nThis leads perfectly on to my next point. Half way through the story (the start of volume ii) we are told that the conversation has ended. We then hear the visitor s description of the servant s narrative about Heathcliff s life. I mean seriously? So there are three layers of storytelling. Isn t that completely unnecessary and overcomplicated? Why not just have Heathcliff tell the story or at the very least have the servant tell the story from start to finish in one story arc with no time shifts. For me, it felt like Emily wrote herself into a corner with her choice of narrative and desperately tried to write herself out of it to the point of ridiculousness. How much of the story can we believe? How much bias is in the narratives?\n\nThen there was the dialogue overloads. Large parts of the novel were entirely conversational. The narration was minimalistic and bare. The only character whose thoughts we were privy to, again Nelly the servant, was completely irrelevant to the plot. Who cares about the servant s emotion and reactions? This isn t her story; thus, the dialogue was packed out to the point of unnaturalness to fit in the thoughts of characters whose minds we weren t privy to. Simply put, the characters said things people wouldn t realistically say in conversation. It was overflowing with emotions and private thoughts. It was awkward. I m not talking about private conversations, those don t happen as Nelly is awkwardly present for every single event, but announcements or decisions (that should be internal) announced to a group of people. This is why plays have asides and soliloquies. And this is why novels aren t told from the perspective of a random servant.\n\nThere is clearly a great story here. Plot wise the novel is wonderful. But the way in which Emily told her story was nothing short of disastrous. It felt like a wasted opportunity. I m absolutely horrified at how poor it is. This novel needed to be taken apart, re-wrote, and put back together again. Perhaps then it would have been worthy of the story it failed to tell. I ve never been so massively underwhelmed in such a blatant lack of skill in a canonised piece of literature, one that has immense critical reception.\n\n___________________________________\n\nYou can connect with me on social media via .\n__________________________________\nShow more",

            "content": "5 tormenting and passionate stars for a reading experience like no other, because never have I read a book that altered my emotions so many times in one book. My feelings moved in waves between compassion and despair, admiration and loathing, pity but always regret. Victims or tormentors   that s for you to decide.\n\nFor me, Wuthering Heights is an epic and timeless classic that has everything; obsession, greed, revenge, grief, emotional abuse, inequality, and even light horror. Everything except the thing most associated with this story. In my opinion, this is not a love story   it is the most beautiful love story that never happened, and in that lies the tragedy and the power of this book.\n\nIt is a sobering waste of life and love, as the cruelty and selfishness of the characters shape their own story against the rigidity of an intolerant class system that pretty much predestined their fate anyway. Yet the unbreakable bond that existed between the two main characters sees them pursue each other   but always when it was too late, with the haunting realisation that this self-destruction is set to continue into the next generation as the sins of the parents threaten to live on through the children with the same cruelty and brutality they heaped on each other.\n\nA brutal yet passionate story. A story about love, desire, and obsession but with ugly consequences, made all the more intense for its Victorian England setting.\n\nIn fact, Victorian realism at its best. Raw, rigid, unforgiving, and profoundly devastating.\n\n\n\nHeathcliff becomes part of the family as Thrushcross Grange, when Mr Earnshaw takes the orphaned boy home to be part of the family. Accepted by Cathy, but bullied by Hindley, Heathcliff s early start in life is sad and pitiful. Contrast that to the man who becomes obsessed with Cathy, and whose life is turned upside down when the teenage Cathy ultimately chooses wealth over love and marries Linton.\n\nOverhearing a conversation where Cathy admits that Heathcliff will never be a man of means, he flees the Grange and only returning when he has acquired a fortune. What he didn t hear from the last part of the conversation was Cathy professing her unwavering love for Heathcliff with the iconic words , despite now being married to someone else. A haunting tale as the flawed decisions and their self-destructive nature dam the lives and outcomes of these soulmates.\n\nHowever, in an act of revenge Heathcliff marries Cathy s sister-in-law, Isabella, and fathers the son who is then to meet Cathy s daughter in the second half of the book. Hope or hopelessness?\n\n\n\nNot all stories have to be cheerful with happy endings   after all that s life, but it is how we respond to those that defines us. This brings me straight to the characterisation in the book, which is absolutely superb. Whether you like or loathe these characters, there is no doubt they were brilliantly cast. In fact, as a character study not one of the characters can elicit a single ounce of admiration from its readers, with the exception of the young Cathy and Hareton. Yet they all make tremendous book characters.\n\nThe writing style is perfect for the storyline and even the dull palette colours depicting the moors and weather reflects the mood of the book and sense of forlorn and hopelessness, as does Wuthering Heights itself. A place naked to the elements, with surroundings that are untamed and raw that mirror the characters central to the story.\n\nA Love story?   Although romantism has a powerful influence on the story, this is not a love story. Instead, it is a powerful story of love and unity of two souls, in life and in death. The iconic words will resonate with many, as Cathy explains .. . Those words get me in the feelers every time. Powerful and heartbreaking.\n\nFrom the outset and throughout, I was invested in this story, the writing and particularly with the characters as you feel this connected sense of cruelty, self-destruction, and mourning for the countless memories and happiness for the life and love that could have been - but never was. Yet as a reader we are left with guarded optimism for the future of the young Cathy and Heathcliff, or are they too caught in this perpetual cycle of self-destruction, like their parents.\n\nThe writing in these classics is not for everyone, and I confess to struggling with it at school. If you can embrace this writing style, then you will love it. In fact, I just finished a mainstream thriller and I turned to my husband and said 'now I really do need a fix from the classics'. If I had one niggle, I don t like authors writing in local dialect that is too cryptic. For example  aut ne ink  meaning  ought not think . For me personally it disrupts the flow of the story, spoils the beautiful writing in these classics but brings little to it. Back to the book.\n\nA painful drama and an unapologetic portrayal of the flawed and imperfect human mind and heart. Dark, chilling and so vividly depicted. Beautifully written but not a beautiful story. A book where love, grief, and betrayal fuel cruelty and revenge.\n\nHeart-breaking, savage, and self-destructive. Nevertheless, a masterpiece, particularly in its characterisation and the character development.\nShow more",

            "content": "If you've been following my status updates as I read this book, you can probably guess what kind of review this is going to be. (answer: the best kind!) So let's get the good stuff out of the way first, and then I can start the ranting.\n\nGood stuff: I liked some of the characters. Ellen was sweet, and seemed to be the only sensible person in the story. And lord, does she get put through a lot of shit. Girlfriend needs a hug and a spa weekend after all she's been through. I also liked Catherine II and Hareton - unlike their romantic predecessors (and believe me, we'll get to those two soon), they were likeable most of the time. Sure, they had their jackass moments, but considering their respective upbringings, can you really blame them? Also, they reminded me of Bender and Claire from . Like I said, kind of irritating and stupid, but sweet.\nI also appreciated the incredible passion of the story (and the passionate emotions it raised in me) Sure, I hated Heathcliff, but even swooned a little during his final scene with Cathy. Sure, Emily Bronte has written the most terrifying portrayal of a love story I've ever seen (? Pfft.), but she did it really, really well. Terrifying as it is. Which brings me to the next section of this review...\n\nBad Stuff: I cannot, for the life of me, understand why anyone thinks this is a love story. It's a horror story of love and passion gone horribly, horribly wrong, and Heathcliff is one of the greatest villains ever created in literature.\nNotice I said \"villain\" and not \"antihero.\" Heathcliff is not an antihero. He is a sociopath, and for the last fifty pages of the story I wanted to violently murder him so badly that my hands were shaking as I held the book. He is evil.\nCathy doesn't get my sympathy, either. She was a spoiled, unfeeling bitch during every moment she was present in the story, and it's only because she was dead by page 200 that she didn't make me as angry as Heathcliff did - she simply didn't have enough time.\nBut let's get back to Heathcliff - I cannot outline here all of the evil things he did over the course of the story, and to do so would probably be to give away spoilers. Let me just say this: I now understand completely why is being advertised in bookstores as \"Bella and Edwards Favorite Book!\". It should be. As I said in a comment on one of my statuses: Edward Cullen is good, but Heathcliff wrote the fucking on Domestic Abuse Thinly Disguised As Love.\nI don't know why so many readers get all fangirly over Heathcliff. He's an asshole, a sociopath, and even knows how evil he is. As he says of Isabella, a girl he marries and then treats so horribly I can't even talk about it right now: \"She abandoned them under a delusion...picturing in me a hero of romance, and expecting unlimited indulgences from my chivalrous devotion. I can hardly regard her in the light of a rational creature, so obstinately has she persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my character, and acting on the false impression she has cherished.\"\n\nHear that, Heathcliff fangirls? Even thinks you're all morons for liking him.\n\nAnd, just to end this on a good note: I've shared this webcomic before, but it fits here too because, let's face it, the Bronte sisters had\nShow more",

Written between October 1845 and June 1846.\n\nMost of the novel is the story told by housekeeper Nelly Dean to Lockwood, though the novel \"uses several narrators (in fact, five or six) to place the story in perspective, or in a variety of perspectives\".\n\nEmily Bront  uses this frame story technique to narrate most of the story. Thus, for example, Lockwood, the first narrator of the story, tells the story of Nelly, who herself tells the story of another character. The use of a character, like Nelly Dean is \"a literary device, a well-known convention taken from the Gothic novel, the function of which is to portray the events in a more mysterious and exciting manner\".\n\n                (                ) -              (           )                                   1847                \n\n                         :                                                                      (             )                                       (             )                    (                )                    (             )                                                                                                         (               )                                     (                    )                     (               )                     :     1977               :     1998                 :            2007      \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                               -    299          1334                                         1348                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               (     )                                                                                                                                       \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                       (      )                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n\n                   02/06/1399              12/05/1400               .        \nShow more",

This book is dense and thick and confusing, and with a class full of haters, it was hard to wrap my head around it. I subsequently read it three or four more times for classes in college and every time I read it, I loved it more. I always found some new, fascinating piece of the story I had never picked up on.\n\nThe last time I read it, I suddenly realized that there were many hints and clues that Heathcliff could, in fact, be black. A quick shot at research into Liverpool, where Mr. Earnshaw found the urchin, shows that it was the home to a thriving slave trade. This theory completely changes the story, in my opinion.\n\nOr the thought someone brought up in our seminar on the Brontes - what if Nellie is in love with Heathcliff and subsequently altered how she told the story? You do find Nellie to be coincidently involved in many key scenes throughout the text. What if she isn't the good guy most readers assume she is?\n\nWuthering Heights is one of the quintessential novels in history. There's nothing else you can really say about it, except that it's one of the best pieces of writing to ever be created. It's just that incredible.\n\nFinished for the 5th time - 11/25/2014\nShow more",

On (finally) getting back to his lodgings he gets to hear the very dark history (recounted back to him over a number weeks) of the families that lived at Wuthering Heights and at his lodgings, The Grange. This book tells that story, a story of human savagery, artfully penned, taking on themes of gender equality, class, hypocrisy, selfishness, envy, and let's not forget, the frailty of the male ego. Emily Bront 's only finished novel caused a bit of a sensation when it was first published, and even today verges on being a tale of horror! I loved every single page of it, and spent an entire day wolfing it down. I had no idea that this work would be so readable and addictive. 9 out of 12, flaming Four Star read.\n\nShow more",

            "content": "Cathy and Heathcliff, a love story? At the beginning of our narrative Mr.Lockwood a tenant of Thrushcross Grange, visits his landlord Mr.Heathcliff at Wuthering Heights, four long miles away across the cold, eerie, moors, people back then walked a great distance they had few options without much complaining, troubled Lockwood wants to get away from society (he came to the right place). The setting is northern England 1801, in the Yorkshire Moors a vast, remote, desolate and gloomy grassland beautiful and ugly at the same time, a haunting locale. Lockwood is the only person who likes Heathcliff \" a capital fellow\" in the area, he sees something no one else does on his mournful face, sadness maybe even regret ( like himself) ? Later he learns the story of his landlord's tragic life, through Mrs.Nelly Dean his servant at Thrushcross Grange for three generations , she tells him about the life of Heathcliff found in the streets of Liverpool hungry , crying, dirty all alone without anyone caring there at the tender age of two, but the compassionate Mr.Earnshaw a wealthy man , Catherine's (Cathy's) father and takes him home. They never discovered the boy's true identity but because of the child's dark complexion, everyone calls him a gypsy. The two, Catherine and Heathcliff, grow up as brother and sister at Wuthering Heights always together Cathy and the unwanted orphan, playing on the lonely moors, they are soulmates . Resented by Cathy's older brother Hindley, (who beats him many times) in fact everyone does, still the gentle Mr.Earnshaw loves the boy. Morose, showing no emotions he can't afford to, still very angry underneath because of how others treat him, as an inferior, Heathcliff was never given another name. When teenager Cathy decides to marry Edgar Linton from a respected well off family and Heathcliff hears about it , he disappears to parts unknown the penniless man feels betrayed....Years pass and Heathcliff comes back from America rich, nobody learns how and he doesn't say either, probably not quite honestly and seeks vengeance. The children of each estate the Linton's of Thrushcross Grange and the Earnshaw's of Wuthering Heights, inherit their respective homes, Cathy wants to maintain a friendship and maybe more with Heathcliff, the weak Edgar of course hates the gypsy yet can't stop the two from seeing each other, the attraction is too powerful. The triangle will soon dissolve, people come and go but the moors abide. Strong novel with a bittersweet plot... Love or despise this classic, you cannot help but admire its quality.\nShow more",

            "content": "Here s my choice for flashback Saturday at the time of another Mercury retrograde! One of my all time favorite classics: Wuthering Heights.\n\nThe readers of this unconventional, provocative masterpiece truly diverted in two sides: haters and true admirers.\n\nI m one of the admirers because I always like to read about honest approach to the monsters wearing human furs in the real world. Catherine and Heathcliff are irritating, extremely selfish, destructive, illogical characters. They can be definite as threatening monsters. The claustrophobic, dark, agitating world building at Yorkshire moors: desolated, remote, freezing grassland reflects true beauty and ugliness at the same time ( like the reflection of its own habitants) combines with the dark souls of the characters and push you into depressive,intense, bleak world of them filled with grudge, hatred, resentment.\n\nWhy a man turn into a monster? Abuse he endured throughout the years from his family can manipulate his mind and make him think he s not worthy enough. His bottled up anger, growing inferiority complex, sadness pushed him so far to kill the last pieces of humanity left in his body. He turns into a violent man beating his wife, cursing to his faith, becoming more vindictive at each second, fueling himself with the pain of the others just like he suffered when he witnessed his soulmate chose to marry with someone else and deep inside he is still humiliated Gypsy orphan boy even though now he is rich and powerful man . But in the meantime the man is still capable to feel passionate love. Did his obsessive love feed his hatred and push him too far to plan his vindictive revenge?\n\nHe s not the only villain of the story, his true love Catherine is also selfish, vicious, filed with hatred. The anger inside of them darkens their souls. They slowly decay and turn into ruthless creatures who don t carry any piece of empathy.\nCatherine and Heathcliff s story was too intimidating, destructive, unconventional for 19th century of England but as far as I can see it s still way too much complex, heartfelt, painful for the world we re living in, too.\n\nMulti POVed storytelling technique and the heartbreaking, moving, extremely disturbing, dark, traumatic and truly tragic story of two most argumentative characters of the literature still haunt my soul but like a moth to a flame I cannot help myself to be drawn to this book over and over again.\n\nHere are my favorite quotes:\n Do I want to live? . . . [W]ould you like to live with your soul in the grave? \n\n Be with me always take any form drive me mad! only do not leave me in this abyss, where I cannot find you! \n\n I m tired of being enclosed here. I m wearying to escape into that glorious world, and to be always there: not seeing it dimly through tears, and yearning for it through the walls of an aching heart: but really with it, and in it. \n\n He s more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same. \n\n You loved me then what right had you to leave me? \n\n I m now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society, be it country or town. A sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself. \n\n I have to remind myself to breathe almost to remind my heart to beat! \nShow more",

            "content": "I read this book for my AP Literature class. I loved the teacher, loved the subject matter, and loved pretty much everything else we had read, so I had high hopes for this book. I must say, I made a genuine and sincere effort to like this book, I really did. I got half way through with no hope in sight, yet I perservered, hoping the second half would show promise in the next generation. No such luck. Although nothing tops the finale \"love scene\" between Heathcliff and Katherine, with Heathcliff foaming at the mouth and a verbal battle of \"no, YOU killed me\" \"no, you killed yourself\" (a stupidity hiterto unknown since the \"no YOU'RE prettier\" battles). Eventually, the final pages came into view and I was desperate- there must be some redemption for this junk! Some message, some ending sequence, SOMETHING that makes this worthwhile. The characters are so self-absorbed and posses an unprecendeted lack of intelligence, yet are still portrayed as intelligent by the literary world, that it seemed like the only fitting ending would be the characters realizing their stupidity and engaging in a mass suicide. No such luck. Every last word was idiotic and as empty as the first. But you know what grinds my gears even more than the fact that I wasted a week on this worthless pseudo-classic? It kills me that people not only mistake this hoax for real literature, but reference it for ROMANTIC value! Foaming at the mouth, marrying someone you don't love, wow.... now that's a level of romance lovers fantasize about achieving.\nShow more",

It is a story of complicated relationships in and between families. It is a story of rebels. It is a story of a few selfish characters who will try to do anything for their benefit. This is the beauty of this novel. It can be viewed from multiple angles, and we can see many embedded themes in it, giving us a different reading experience every time we read it in various phases of our life.\n\nEmily Bronte has crafted this story in such a way that the story of the Earnshaws and the Lintons and Heathcliff and Catherine will stay in our minds forever. If you are a lover of classics, this is unequivocally the book you should never miss.\n\nShow more",

            "content": " People feel with their hearts, Ellen, and since he has destroyed mine, I have not power to feel for him. \n\nOkay, I know that Wuthering Heights is so many people s favorite book of all-time, and so many people s least favorite book of all-time, so I went into this not really knowing what to expect. I will be honest, I didn t really love it, but I was for sure not expecting the wild ride that this story took me on. I just truly found all of the characters (Except for Ellen/Nelly) to be so damn insufferable.\n\nBut this is a story set in 1801, about a man named Mr. Lockwood, staying the night at Wuthering Heights. He meets a man named Heathcliff, who seems absolutely miserable, and he meets a housekeeper named Ellen Dean who will eventually help us figure out why Heathcliff is so miserable. Oh, and when Lockwood goes to sleep that night, he is awoken by a ghost! He then tells Ellen this, and she promptly throws us back into a flashback, where she becomes the new narrator, and we get to see what went down at Wuthering Heights many years ago.\n\n, at its black heart, is a story all about abuse, and cycles of abuse, and how abuse can impact so many hearts and so many generations repeatedly. Abuse and cruelty truly breed violence, and Heathcliff and everyone he has been forced to interact with just showcase that theme over and over. Heathcliff was orphaned and taken in, but everyone reminds him that he constantly is an outsider. But this story focuses on him and the three young people he grew up alongside of, and they are all shitty in their own ways.\n\n  is shitty because he only cares for Catherine.\n  is shitty because she only cares about Heathcliff.\n  is shitty because he doesn t care about his sister.\n  is shitty because she only cares about herself.\n\n\nAnd friends, it is a truly wild ride seeing these characters interact with one another. And we eventually get to see their children who (you guessed it) are shitty, too! Again, cycles of abandonment and abuse is truly heartbreaking in every aspect.\n\nI don t want to say too much more without spoiling, because I really do think the twists are pretty decent in this and figuring out more about the ghost was a big highlight for me. Also, the atmosphere was phenomenal, and the Yorkshire moors truly set a beautiful stage for this dark tale. And I feel like this is a little bit of an unpopular opinion; but I actually really liked Emily s prose, too.\n\nI do want to say that upon finishing this story, I immediately started to look up things about the entire Bront  family, and my heart just broke. The things that those sister, and their entire family, had to go through. I know 2019 is kind of a dumpster fire, but I am so thankful that I wasn t born in the 1800s, good Lord. Also, reading about how closely tuberculosis impacted this story and Emily s life truly fucked me up, especially because I m close to Emily s age when she died. Seriously, I have so much love and respect in my heart for these three sisters, originally writing their dark tales under male pseudonyms, who will now never be forgotten.\n\nOverall, even though I didn t love this story, this book was enjoyable enough to read. But you re never going to find me romanticism anything that Heathcliff did. But I truly couldn t wait to find out what happened next to all these insufferable characters. And I still firmly believe that Ellen/Nelly deserves the entire world. Also, I had the biggest giggle while reading about someone throwing hot applesauce at someone else, because like, just imagine that.\n\n| | | | |\n\nfor use of the word g*psies, death, loss of a loved one, a lot of physical and emotional abuse, alcohol abuse, child abuse, animal abuse, humiliation, self-harm, and abandonment.\nShow more",

            "content": "There are some books that you either love of hate; there is not much middle ground. Like some types of food. Marmite or licorice come to mind. Wuthering Heights is one of those books. Since I started using GR I have read many conflicting reviews for this book and they made me increasingly curios to find out which side I would take. Unfortunately, I am more with the hate party.\n\nI will not write a long review here as it was done thousands of times. I will only say that the book took all the joy of living from me and put me into a reading slump from which I hope to heal quickly. After I finished this last night I was considering what to read next and I realized I did not want to read anything for a while, I felt catatonic.\n\nI believe I started the book on a wrong foot. I was expecting a love story, which in my opinion it is not. Instead, I think this is a very well done study of two sociopaths, pathologically obsessed with each other who manage to destroy the life of everyone they know for the fun of it. Their ability to hurt others and each other is so extraordinary that I might consider this book from the paranormal genre.\n\nYes, I appreciate that the novel is revolutionary for the period and so on but I did not enjoy it at all. Dear friends that love this novel, I am really sorry I did not like it more and I hope you will not take it personally.\n\nDisclaimer: I read it in Romanian, the way I prefer to read all Victorian novels in order to avoid the archaic language. Maybe I was lost in translation.\nShow more",

The one you feed.\"\n- Cherokee legend\n\nI have to start by saying Holy cats! That was not what I was expecting.\n\nThis fabulous tale begins with bumbling Mr. Lockwood, who wishes to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city and looks forward to the beautiful country life. He s on a mission to rent Thrushcross Grange from its owner, who also owns Wuthering Heights Manor. He s welcomed as much as anyone would welcome the plague and is met with harsh treatment, as well as pack of ill-tempered dogs who violently maul him. Add to that a snowstorm that puts him in his sickbed, this rural getaway is beginning to seem like a capital idea!\n\nAs Mr. Lockwood convalesces at Thrushcross Grange, he becomes acquainted with the keeper of the house, Ellen Dean. Treading lightly after his previous encounters with these inhospitable people he approaches Miss Dean with caution and inquires after the intriguing inhabitants of Wuthering Heights. Ellen - or Nelly, as she s known- is of a kinder disposition. She rushes off to get her knitting and settles in to tell the tale of all of the broken souls who haunt the halls of these once-grand homes.\n\nI m snuggled in with my new friends engrossed in the saga of Heathcliff, the foundling gipsy child and Catherine, the daughter of his benefactor (and their magnetic attraction), eagerly listening to Nelly regale the history of the Earnshaws and the Lintons, her knitting needles clicking away, when she tells of Heathcliff's hasty departure! By now, I am completely captivated, and that s when Nelly ceases the recounting, stating that Mr. Lockwood needs his sleep. Never mind his sleep! I grumbled. Lockwood and I don't need any sleep, woman! Get on with it!\n\nI wanted to reach into the pages and shake her! Where has Heathcliff gone? And what is going to happen to Cathy? Those two are the Richard Burton and Liz Taylor of their day! Tell! Tell! And be quick about it!\n\nThankfully, Nelly returned to the story after some urging from my good man Lockwood, and we find that Cathy has married Edgar Linton! She s living at Thrushcross Grange with Edgar and his sister Isabella, and they are as happy as clams.\n\nThen the poo hits the proverbial fan back at Wuthering Heights.\n\nMr. Heathcliff comes strolling back into the picture, slick as you please, after three years away. He's looking all Rico Suave as he pops over to Cathy s new digs, intending to stir the fire in her loins. And here she is married to another. Oh my! Next, the wilting flower, Isabella, upon laying her baby blues on ol' Heathcliff has a mighty yearning for the brooding bad boy, and all the while the devilish rogue is licking his chops at the thought of her juicy money. Cathy turns lime green with jealousy and Nelly is about to have a breakdown over the whole hot mess. It's code red over there!\n\nThe outcome for these dismally unhappy folks could hardly be a 'happily ever after' one ... Or could it? I won t spoil for anyone who is yet to read this engrossing melodrama. The story is wild, dark and stormy, and I devoured it as if I was starving. The prose is so evocative as to create a movie in my mind that culminates in a spectacular finish. A story of vengeance, love, greed and the cost of evil deeds; but could there also be redemption?\n\nOne of my favorite lines; Cathy says of Heathcliff:\n\n\nI would urge anyone who hasn t read this dazzling novel, to please give it a try. I m still reeling!\nShow more",

            "content": "SPOILERS\n\nBehold the wild, dark side of love.\n\n I am Heathcliff   he s always, always in my mind   not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself   but as my own being. \n\nPassion. Desire. Love. Are they the same thing? If we are so intoxicated by someone as ending up seeing them as a mirror to our own self, is this love? It is. Sometimes. But sometimes it is sign not of devotion, but of egotism so strong that it stops us from seeing the actual person and we imagine a likeness that isn t there just in order to fulfill our needs. I believe that Catherine loves Heathcliff, but I don t believe she understands him or desires to. By believing he would agree to her plan she shows how little she takes into account what he actually is. She is so lost in her passion that she isn t willing to admit the difference between them. It is a dangerous thing to be so absorbed by passion for someone that you don t even care to understand and accept them for who they are. You just want to own them. By making the choice of marrying another man and keeping Heathcliff by her side as a lover whom she would support with her husband s money she gives up on the very thing that has connected them so far, on the very thing that has stood at the core of their love. Freedom. They both grow up as captives of society that does not understand and accept them for who they are. He is the only one in front of whom she can be herself and she is the only one in front of whom he can be himself. But by choosing to dissemble and submit, Catherine loses that spark that initially connects them. She believes it is for their own good. He is heartbroken. When he comes back, he spends so much time and energy trying to bring back a girl who no longer exists. He cannot stand the woman she has turned herself into. In this case, is he still in love with her or merely in the memory of her? When the person we have loved loses the part that has held our affections, when should we give up on them and when should we devote ourselves to restoring that part?\n\n\n\nTheir tragedy lies exactly in the fact that they are the same. He wants freedom, she wants security. Benjamin Franklin says I neither agree, nor disagree. I believe it is a very subjective matter. It isn t that simple. But in the case of Catherine it really does turn out this way. In the end she has neither comfort, nor freedom.\n\nHow much do we know those who we claim to love? We all risk to see something that isn t actually there or miss something that is. Either blinded by passion or by our desire to recreate the objects of our passion. If we cannot truly accept our loved ones for who they are and we try to change them, then do we truly love or simply those we would like them to be? Can such a distinction be made? Or is it a little bit of both? Do we love only those parts of our partners that resemble ourselves or are we willing to love even those we cannot accept? Are love and acceptance the same thing? It isn t uncommon for a person to try changing their loved one, but sometimes the good and the bad come from the same place and if we happen to succeed, we are at risk of destroying the good as well. Catherine tries to tame Heathcliff and in doing so, she destroys him. His passionate love turns into passionate hatred.\n\nFeeling so close to someone as not to know where you end and they begin is either a sign of profound affinity or a profound delusion. Love is merciful and cruel, generous and selfish, sorrow and ecstasy. We all lose something and gain something by choosing to give into another person. Change is inevitable. Sometimes we get stronger, sometimes we are ruined. Sometimes it is a little bit of both. Some of us find their worthy partners, some, sadly, never do. But I believe that no matter on which side of the coin you turn out, staying faithful to yourself is always the right choice.\n\nRead count: 2\nShow more",

            "content": "Not often do I decide to edit the review - and change the opinion of the book I initially detested - mere days after writing a 'why I hated it' opus. Emily Bronte, you mastermind!\n\nIn addition to learning truly horrifying things through the comments from my fellow lovely Goodreaders (people have told me that not only Heathcliff and Catherine's horrible story served as an inspiration for 'Twilight - a story that's paraded as a love story; and - brrrr - that \"in almost all polls on most romantic literary figure, Heathcliff takes the lead\") I read :\n... a comment that, combined with her observation in another comment that led me to realize that\n\n\n\nTwo Catherines in this book - and both of them take a journey between the stops of 'Catherine Earnshaw', 'Catherine Heathcliff' and 'Catherine Linton' - because what other options do they have? Even young Cathy, so seemingly close to possibly leaving this enclosed corner of the universe thanks to sudden fascination Lockwood (a man of the outside world) takes to her, ultimately remains tightly tethered to the place she knows, remaining with an Earnshaw - her first cousin (because who else is there?)\n\nHeathcliff, who could have had the world, comes back to rule the little universe into which he was adopted, unable to leave the country of grey moors.\n\nAnd everyone else is a Linton - another link in the chain that connects everyone else. And the little world of this novel takes no one else in who is not a Linton, a Cathy or an incarnation of Heathcliff/Hareton/Hindley. Everyone stays together, their fates tied only to one another, with disregard to the world outside. Only Isabella (who never seems to have fit into this world anyway) manages to escape - but remains tethered to this world by her child, Linton Heathcliff, who - thanks to his names - is powerless to escape being sucked into this little corner of the universe and become a pathetic little villain.\n\n\n\nOk, mindblowing. Enough to up my star rating by a full star.\n\n\n\n------------\n------------\n\n\n------------\nOk, I'll be honest - I decided to read this one really because the word had for a while been fascinating my non-native speaker brain \n\n\nPlus, I have also been introduced to it by - of course! - pop culture, courtesy of Phoebe Buffay:\n\n\n\n------------------------\nOk, back to serious now.\n\nThe narrator's stumbling into Heathcliff's household leads to the opening chapter as surreal and creepy as a nightmare you really want to wake up from but cannot. Seriously, let's look back to the beginning of the tale - with Heathcliff, and the dogs, and the creepiest servant since , and strange perplexing characters of Hareton and Cathy, . Lovely, just lovely.\nI was promised passion and wilderness. It's not wild passion; it's self-absorbed selfishness and nothing more.\n\n\n\nNo, I'm not a fan of anger, revenge and possessiveness trying to masquerade as wild love and passion.\n\n\nHeathcliff is not wild - he is a cruel sociopath. Catherine is not wild and passionate - she is a haughty and spoiled thoughtless creature.\n\nAnd I cannot help asking, dear reader -\n--------------\nYes, I understand the ovaries needed for making such repulsive personalities be the center of your story (actually, that's not just Cathy and Heathcliff being repugnant; think of Hindley, and Hareton, and - brrrr! - Joseph, and young Linton, and even young Cathy, and to a point the ever-meddling self-righteous unsure-where-her-allegiance-lies-but-probably-with-whoever-the-current-master-happens-to-be Nelly Dean), and to systematically beat out any possible feel-good moment in this book. It probably was not an easy book to write, and definitely is not an easy book to read.\n\nBut because of all that I could not bring myself to care in the least.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, all throughout, I realized that I just could no longer care about the story that brought two English families living on the wild moors to the state that the narrator observes in such a promising beginning of this book. It tried too hard to unapologetically be dark and brooding and bleak - and succeeded in just wearing me out.\n\nand valiant attempts to dodge the shower of rotten eggs and rotten tomatoes heading my way.\nShow more",

            "content": " Sea cual sea la sustancia de la que est n hechas nuestras almas, la suya y la m a son id nticas. \n\nEl escritor H.P. Lovecraft en su famoso ensayo  El horror sobrenatural en la literatura  ubicaba a esta inmortal novela de Emily Bront  entre las mejores del g nero del terror.\nPara  l, el hecho de que Heathcliff profanara dos veces la tumba de Catherine era tremendo.\nDebe haber sido verdaderamente shockeante para el editor Henri Colburn permitir publicar  Cumbres borrascosas  en 1847, luego del escozor que le habr  causado leer esta novela que Emily, bajo el seud nimo de Ellis Bell dio a luz en una  poca completamente vedada para las mujeres en todo aspecto. Y la literatura no era la excepci n.\nSu hermana Charlotte se transform  en Currer Bell y Anne en Acton Bell. Los editores pensaban que todos los Bell eran en realidad un solo escritor (hombre), pero se equivocaron completamente.\nLa vida de las tres hermanas Bront  y de su  nico hermano Branwell est  signada por la tuberculosis y la muerte: en 1848, la malograda vida de Emily se apaga: muere de tuberculosis en diciembre. Su hermano Branwell hab a muerto tres meses antes y un a o despu s su hermana Anne correr a la misma suerte.\nCharlotte durar a algunos a os m s y tambi n morir a en 1855. Una verdadera desgracia se las llev  a todas estas autoras que habr an dejado m s novelas inmortales adem s de  Jane Eyre ,  Agnes Grey ,  Villette  y esta obra de arte,  Cumbres borrascosas  en donde se nos ofrece la idea del punto sin retorno al que el amor puede arrastrar a algunas personas.\nEsta historia tuvo caracter sticas emblem ticas, poderosas y revolucionarias para la  poca en que se escribi , dado la violencia impl cita en todos los  rdenes en que Emily Bront  la escribi : desde el lugar donde transcurre toda la acci n, que no es la cosmopolita Londres sino los desolados p ramos de Yorkshire donde todo el tiempo el clima es horrible, el terreno es agreste, la vegetaci n espantosa y el viento no da tregua a nadie, a punto tal de que no est  mejor puesto el nombre de la finca al llamarse  Cumbres borrascosas \nLa violencia tambi n est  en el lenguaje, los personajes, tanto hombres como mujeres vociferan, insultan, gritan y se maltrata. Violencia en los gestos, en los constantes golpes entre los personajes, en las actitudes desafiantes y las continuas amenazas.\nEs incre ble comprender que toda esta novela fue escrita por una se orita de treinta a os, educada en una familia de buena posici n y que no sufri  ni hambre ni miserias aunque s  de una salud muy fr gil.\nEs m s, su hermana Charlotte, promotora de la literatura de Emily y defensora a ultranza de alguna calumnia surgida por all  supo decir que su hermana era Brillante manera de describir a alguien,  verdad?\nTodos los acontecimientos que rodean a la tormentosa historia de amor (para ponerle el adjetivo calificativo exacto) entre Heathcliff y Catherine  especialmente en la primera parte- se complementa de pasajes sobrenaturales, estados alterados, pasiones descontroladas y crueldad aterradora.\nLa novela se sale de canon del tradicional del romanticismo y del Romanticismo de tal manera que adquiere una entidad y caracter sticas propias, dado que la autora maneja las atm sferas de tensi n a la perfecci n y todo el conjunto de la relaci n tanto de los dos personajes principales como de los dem s est  ensamblada y sin fisuras.\nEs importante destacar algo importante a la hora de leer  Cumbres Borrascosas  y es que ser  esencial contar con un  rbol geneal gico de las dos familias que se enfrentan (algo que no hice en mi primera lectura), ya que al igual que en  Cien a os de soledad  los personajes se llaman igual o tienen el mismo apellido con la complicaci n de que algunos son primos y se casan entre s  y de este modo leeremos repetidas veces el nombre Catherine, el apellido Earnshaw, el apellido Linton (que tambi n es un nombre).\nEs tanta la confusi n si el lector no est  prevenido, que se encontrar  a lo largo de la historia con Catherine Earnshaw, Catherine Linton y Catherine Heathcliff. Mismo caso para los Linton a partir de que Heathcliff como despecho por el casamiento de Catherine con Hindley Linton se casar  con Isabella, hermana de este que le dar  un ni o que se llamar  Linton. Realmente complejo.\nVolviendo a la novela y como explicara anteriormente, debido a la naturaleza de los personajes y las situaciones y de la violencia que los rodea a todos adem s del agreste lugar en el que viven, es muy dif cil encontrar algo parecido en las otras novelas de su  poca.\nY dir a que ni siquiera podemos trazar una similitud ni con  Jane Eyre  ni con  Agnes Grey  o  La inquilina de Wildfell Hall , ya que la naturaleza de estas otras historias est n caracterizadas principalmente por la lucha desventajosa de la mujer del siglo XIX por sobrevivir en un mundo de hombres quienes a su vez son los due os de todo.\nAqu  la cuesti n es otra y pasa por la descontrolada y salvaje manera de zanjar las diferencias del coraz n y de poseer (usualmente a la fuerza en el caso de Heathcliff) al otro.\nHeathcliff es un personaje que a partir de que crece y se hace hombre se transforma en el t pico villano que todo lo controla y que a la vez todo destruye y se nota el trabajo que Emily Bront  se tom  para delinear sus caracter sticas, ya que no se encuadra en el t pico arquetipo del caballero o gentleman ingl s de su  poca. Suele ser violento, iracundo, despreciable, atemorizante y d spota. No existe ning n resquicio de bondad en  l y probablemente nunca la haya tenido. Para muchos lectores es uno de los personajes odiosos de la literatura.\nEl amor y la pasi n y el odio visceral entre Heathcliff y Catherine queda inmortalizada en frases como la que dice ella cuando admite que\nIncluso va m s all :\n l le responde: y termina rematando:\nLeer  Cumbres borrascosas  es dejarse llevar por todo tipo de sentimientos encontrados tanto como lector como ser humano y aunque Emily Bront  solamente escribi  este libro, adquiri  gloria eterna al relatarnos esta tormentosa e inolvidable historia de amor que pocos escritores (pr cticamente ninguno) llegaron a igualar.\nShow more",

            "content": "Wuthering Heights takes us to a world that is somehow outside of all social and moral norms. It's closer to the realm of dreams or Greek myth than the rational everyday life of civilised habit. As if the characters are dramatizing the psyche or the unconscious in the midst of everyday life. Bronte demands we extend our sympathies beyond their brightly-lit habitual moral parameters - rather like Nabokov does in Lolita. Except where Nabokov does it directly through his narrator Bronte is arguably cleverer by providing us with a rather commonplace and reasonable narrator who much more mirrors our own sensibility. Nelly is like a comfortable armchair. You might say the norm in this novel is sociopathic behaviour and yet Nelly with her commonplace emotional economies provides the illusion that everything she recounts is firmly attached to a normal social reality. It's a super clever sleight of hand on Bronte's part. Thus this is a conventional secular narrative we experience in Nelly's armchair about a violent amoral world in which almost everything is outside the realm of civilised etiquette.\n\nStructurally this book is a brilliant enigma. It feels like a series of unconscious decisions on Emily's part which for a novel that spends a lot of time dramatizing the darker realms of the human psyche is another masterstroke. Our narrator is almost immediately shoved aside by a first-hand witness of all events, Nelly, the housekeeper. Bronte uses this technique of doubling up throughout the novel - eventually Catherine and Heathcliff's children will replace Catherine and Heathcliff. Virtually every character in this novel has a twin. At times it's confusing trying to recall who is whose offspring or relative but this only adds to the novel's atmosphere of some kind of elemental drama unfolding in which individuals are no less cyclical, no less driven by primitive energies than the surrounding moors. Wuthering Heights is an adventure into the heart of darkness, anticipating Conrad by more than fifty years. It's also a novel that feels spookily intimate with death.\n\nTo anyone who thinks this a dated novel which belongs fixedly to its time I'd say there are thousands and thousands of modern day Heathcliffs doing time in our prisons and wreaking havoc on our streets, deprived, racially abused, unloved kids who have made it their mission to exact revenge on a cruel pitiless world. This is a way more subtle and far reaching portrait of the plight of the abused child than anything her sister came up with. Jane Eyre is corporate American cinema compared to Heathcliff. Bronte does more than give a voice to the emotionally crippled, the inarticulate, the vindictive outcasts of society; she creates the world they would like to live in, the destruction of virtually everything we associate with civilised society. And shows us too, by eventually civilising Catherine and Heathcliff's respective children, that we all have elements of Heathcliff and Catherine buried down in our psyches which occasionally make an unsettling appearance in our daily life.\nShow more",

            "content": "First book for 2023, and it s a classic, gothic fiction.\nMy first read by a Bront  sister since reading 'Jane Eyre'.\nFirst and only novel by Emily Bront .\nSecond buddy read with Marge Moen: https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2...\nAnd I can't wait to read Marge's insights.\nEmily is one of the three Bront  sisters who initially needed to publish their novels under male pseudonyms - I think that spells volumes about their writing on repression and societal norms of the time.\n\nI can understand why people either love or hate  Wuthering Heights , or are the very least perplexed by it. This is not an easy, pleasant read. And that's probably its appeal for me.\n\nI sit firmly in the 'love' camp.\n\nSo much meanness, violence, ugliness. So many characters suffer from fragile health. Such contrast between strong (aggressive) and weak (sickly) characters.\n\nRevenge is a major aspect of the apparent tortured love storyline. How else can it be described, but a kind of warped love story?\n\nIt is dark, broody and harsh, at times excruciatingly cruel.\n\nHow did Emily Bront  think up these characters and themes? Surely she drew from some of her own experiences? I must do some post-read research.\n\nA few takeaways =\n\nMy expectations were met.\n\nI also responded well to the symbolism:\n Catherine s face was just like the landscape - shadows and sunshine flitting over it in rapid succession; but the shadows rested longer, and the sunshine was more transient  \n\nEllen, the devoted, long term nanny, maid-come-servant endured so much. Too much.\n\nThe old religious-fanatic Joseph, another servant who also suffered through generations of the main characters, spoke in a Yorkshire dialect. Bront  was clever to capture this, but I couldn t understand a lot of it. I fear I ve missed some important plot details. Maybe there s an edition with a translation as footnotes?\n\nAt times, I got a little confused who was who. Bront  invariably switches from Christian names to titles or surnames, and gives offspring the same names as their parents or relatives.\n\nAh, now I m nitpicking, and I didn t want to do that!\n\nI was a little bewildered how Heathcliff, the male anti-hero, turned out so badly. I wanted to like him more. Then again, I m glad Bront  didn t give us stereotypical characters. Maybe I would have been critical if Heathcliff turned out to be all lovey-dovey?\n\nSee what this novel has done to me? I m babbling.\n\nKate Bush s hit by the same name makes a lot more sense to me now.\n\nAn expected 5-star rating just falls short, but that's not to say I didn't love it!\n4.5 stars from me.\nI thought about that trick of raising it to 5 stars, but then thought no, that doesn't paint the right picture.\nAh, still babbling thanks to Cathy and Heathcliff...\nShow more",

The reason this has remained such a firm favourite, and why I try to ensure I reread this at least biennially, however, is that in this intense and focused character study I found myself unaccountably and entirely drawn to every unlikable individual in it. I forgave every flaw and overlooked any ordinarily dislikeable quality in my blind adoration for these passionate creatures.\n\nI was captivated by the raging emotions that dominated, throughout. The wildness of the characters and their uncontrollable fits of frenzy and passion - their deepest of despairs and their most ardent of desires - is also mirrored by the wildness of the landscape surrounding them, creating an eternal and external, extra character in this most infamous of love triangles.\n\nI have reread this so often that I could probably quote every single page, but yet I never fail to find something new to discover on the moors. There is a feeling of never quite being on equal footing that dominates and permeates the entire text. This is a novel that distances the reader: it denies any simple pleasure such as happy-ever-afters or a brief respite from the altering high passions and utter, all-consuming bleakness. I will never feel at home here but I will always long to.\n\nThis has remained my favourite book from first reading until now, ten years later, and I think there's no better endorsement for a book than that!\nShow more",

            "content": "Many people consider this book a masterpiece, a monument of English literature. This novel exudes an incredible force due to Heathcliff's destructive passion for Catherine. Still, for my part, I did not find any character endearing or with which to identify me even slightly.\nLet's start with the narrator, Mrs. Dean. At no time did I feel that she loved Catherine or anyone else. On the contrary, her coldness and moral lessons made her unpleasant.\nAs for Catherine, more unbearable, you die! At first careless and a little proud, but she didn't change much as she grew up. Become weak. I waited for that moment when my heart would melt and feel some semblance of emotion, but nothing.\nHeathcliff is the only character that inspired me anything. Small pity. Adult, pity too!\nUsually, I am fascinated by evil characters, but the plot here is too simple to make Heathcliff a complex man.\nThere's no need to write about my feelings about the other family members because you will understand that this book did not touch me.\nThis novel is dark, yes, but it remains a love story. Nothing sensational.\nShow more",

            "content": "UPDATE: Now with irritating author interview! See end of review.\n\nThose of you who know me know I don t really have favorite authors: I have favorite books, occasionally favorite series. So you won t be surprised that after I thought Half of a Yellow Sun was amazing and Purple Hibiscus and The Thing Around Your Neck fairly good, I m giving 2 stars (edit: 1 star) to Adichie s latest. Typical. But really, yikes! This isn't even a novel: it's a 477-page opinion essay with some characters thrown in.\n\nRead the blurb and you'll be told Americanah is about a pair of star-crossed lovers from Nigeria, Ifemelu and Obinze, following their adventures as immigrants in the U.S. and U.K. respectively. Technically that's in the book, but Americanah is really a series of vignettes in which an endless parade of minor characters talk about race, nationality, and various other issues, with Ifemelu in the background. (Obinze is here more as her love interest than a protagonist in his own right, and we only get a few chapters from his perspective.)\n\nSo here's the thing. If you're looking for a book of observations about race in America, you might like this. Adichie certainly has a lot of them. But for me this bloated book was a complete slog--I read 5 others from start to finish while plodding through it. The most interesting parts of the characters' lives, the moments when something is actually at stake, are breezed through in narrative summary, while the book focuses in on mundane conversations illustrating Adichie's points about race. There's no real plot, no tension or momentum, and I found it impossible to summon any interest in the characters, as I was kept at a distance from them throughout.\n\nThere are two types of scenes here, both of which feel as if they could have been lifted directly from the author's life or the lives of people she knows, and then strung together with little sense of continuity. In the first, Ifemelu encounters someone who says something ignorant, biased or otherwise unfortunate on the subject of race or nationality. In the second, Ifemelu attends a social event where a group of people talk about race or nationality. A revolving door of bit-part characters exists to opine on these subjects: there must be 200+ named characters in this book, almost all of whom appear in only one or two scenes and are developed only through brief sketches. Even in the last 10 pages of the book, Adichie's introducing us to a whole new group of people so that they can talk about the economic problems in Nigeria. Which is representative of the extent to which the entire book is more a platform for the author to talk about issues than a story.\n\nAnd perhaps because Ifemelu's primary role is as an observer who blogs about other people's foibles (actual blog entries are scattered liberally throughout), she mostly comes across as self-righteous and judgmental. When she does act, it's usually to be unpleasant: she passive-aggressively starts fights with her boyfriends, writes personal blog posts about friends without their permission, and when a co-worker criticizes her behavior, her response is to call the co-worker ugly. Ifemelu seems to tolerate other people in her life only insofar as they don't inconvenience her (and she's easily annoyed, by everything from her parents daring to visit her to a boyfriend moving on with his life after she cuts him off), and she radiates disdain for everyone she meets, even those closest to her. Normally I'm a fan of flawed female protagonists, but Ifemelu is neither interesting nor admirable, drifting through a story that seems to take readers' identification with her for granted, with little narrative awareness of her flaws.\n\nAs for the most prominent part of the book then: the discussions about race. My response was mixed. There are certainly some good observations here, and Adichie is absolutely right that there ought to be more novels about how people experience race today, instead of the endless parade of books about slavery or Jim Crow that make us feel good about how far we've come rather than challenging us to do better. Sometimes Adichie exaggerates, although not fatally so--for instance, in a shopping scene where the characters are unable to identify which salesperson helped them because the only way to distinguish between the two is that one is black and one white, and they're unwilling to mention race. This could certainly happen and says something about American society, but Adichie seems quick to generalize, as if all Americans would react in the same way (I doubt most would be as stymied by the situation as the characters presented here). But while Ifemelu is always confident in her opinions, and gets annoyed with people who disagree with her, Adichie merely presents her conclusions rather than leading readers to make them independently. People who don't already agree with her are unlikely to be convinced.\n\nIn the end, I was disappointed because I know Adichie can write great novels, where the focus is on the characters and their story and these elements are developed brilliantly. But that isn't this book. Adichie has a character argue against subtlety in writing novels about race, but surely it's possible to talk about race honestly and tell an engaging story at the same time, rather than sacrificing the latter for the former. I give an extra half-star because the writing is not bad, because those few scenes where she stops pontificating and develops Ifemelu's experiences hooked me, because there are some good observations. But as a novel, Americanah is unsatisfying, and for me proved to be a tedious, heavy-handed slog, easily double the length the plot required. I'll promise here and now that if Adichie decides to publish an essay collection or memoir on the subject, I'll read it. But this cross between blog and novel results in a story and characters too thin to entertain, choked out by observations and opinions that would be better communicated in nonfiction. I simply can't recommend it, and the high rating so far completely mystifies me.\n\nUPDATE: So I read an interview with Adichie , in which she says:\n\n\n\nOh, where do I even begin? First, there's the \"If you don't find my jokes funny, it's definitely not because I'm not funny, it's because you don't that it's to be funny\" angle. Some writers do humor well and some don't. If you don't, best not to claim it's your readers' shortcoming.\n\nSecond, there's the \"Oh, American readers in general don't think it's funny? It's definitely not because it's inside humor that's really only going to appeal to people with similar experiences. It's obviously an American problem, so let's see if I can come up with a stereotype that'll explain it!\" angle. (I mean, WTF, now we're supposed to be earnest? I thought we were supposed to be fun-loving but oblivious, or something. But okay, it's pretty easy to stereotype a country of 315 million people, because whatever trait you come up with, millions of people will have it.) I'm not clear on how the elements some readers have found funny, like Ifemelu's father's pedantic way of speaking, are even related to race, but clearly Adichie would rather blame American racial attitudes (and compliment herself for her bluntness) than just admit she's not the world's best humorist.\n\nThird, it's just so exactly something that Ifemelu would say, and the way she thinks and behaves throughout the book (superior, quick to generalize, always finding fault with others but never ever with herself) that it's really impossible to see Ifemelu as anything other than an author-insert. And you know what's 10 times more annoying than when an author you previously loved writes a book you kind of hate? When you then realize actually you don't think much of the author as a person either.\nShow more",

            "content": "In Nigeria, we are brought up on foreign movies, sitcoms and TV shows, foreign books and foreign news. We know how English should be spoken, and many of us who bother to read a lot are very familiar with the colloquialisms of the west.\n\nThis is perhaps why we do not recognize how much we miss our own particularly Nigerian way of expression in the literature we read. It is perhaps why, when we read a phrase that is essentially Nigerian, in a novel like Americanah...  Tina-Tina, how now?   Why are you looking like a mumu?   How will you cope/how are you coping? ... All of them, familiar Nigerian modes of speech, we are infinitely grateful.\n\nI am probably biased towards this novel, Americanah by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, not only because Adichie s first novel, Purple Hibiscus, which I read as a very young girl, awoke in me the possibility of good writing and beautiful prose by a Nigerian like me, but because of the familiarity of the book.\n\nIt s like the word Americanah, such a Nigerian word, used to describe someone who had lived abroad for so long, they no longer understand the nuances of being Nigerian. They use American swearwords, or complain that the fries at KFC Onikan are limp, even though you see nothing wrong with them. This is when you turn to someone who understands and say, (No mind am, na Americanah), .\n\nAdichie s latest follows Ifemelu, a bright, sharp and observant girl, from her early years in 1990 s Nigeria to a life in America where, after the first rude shocks of culture change in a new world where  fat  is a bad word and not merely a statement of fact, where colour is such a big issue that it can rule people s lives, and where everything is different, she slowly and surely starts to become an Americanah.\n\nIn Americanah, Ifemelu observes, and we are informed by her observations, she converses and we see her character, she remembers, and in her memories we see a rich story that begins in Lagos, journeys through the cities of America, and gains a body that is beautiful to savour. It is through Ifemelu s observations that we experience what Americanah is about.\n\nHair. Specifically Black/African hair. Why do black women hide their hair? Would Beyonce ever allow the world to see her hair the way it really is, or would Michelle Obama? These are the questions Ifemelu asks in her blog, where after having lived in the United States for a long time, she broaches issues of race, hair and life in America from the eyes of a  Non-American Black .\n\nWe experience race. Kimberley, the white woman who uses beautiful as a word to describe  black , because for whichever reason, black is a word that should be said as little as possible. Kurt, to whom Ifemelu s race means nothing, and Blaine, the Black American Yale professor, whose influence, in my opinion, would be the biggest in turning Ifemelu s observations from the disinterested and amused observation of a  Non-American Black  or  NAB , who calmly tells Kimberly,  You know, you can just say  black.  Not every black person is beautiful.  to those of an  American Black  or  AB , who would say in her blog.  If the  slavery was so long ago  thing comes up, have your white friend say that lots of white folks are still inheriting money that their families made a hundred years ago. So if that legacy lives, why not the legacy of slavery?  The old Ifemelu would have told the descendants of the slaves to  get over it .\n\nWe also experience love. Adichie herself describes Americanah as a love story, and this is true. There is love in almost every book, but in Americanah, it is not accidental, it is a central part of the story. Before America, race, and hair became issues, there was Obinze, the love of Ifemelu s teenage life. If Ifemelu, the daughter of a civil servant who lost his job because he would not bow to the excessive respect that Lagos Yorubas employ and call his boss  Mummy , and uses English in such a way as to provide a hilarious sort of comic relief, is sharp and confident, then Obinze, the only son of a university professor, with his love for American books and his quiet belief in himself, is self assured and mature. They fall in love soon after they meet as secondary school students in Lagos, and when Ifemelu tells her aunt and friend, Uju about him, saying she has met the love of her life, there is a hilarious moment when Aunt Uju advises her to  let him kiss and touch but not to let him put it inside. \n\nWhile most of the story is seen though Ifemelu s eyes and memories, we also get to see some of Obinze. We follow him to London, where he lives as an illegal immigrant, after failing to find a job in Nigeria, or to fulfill his dream of going to America. (He later visits America, when he becomes rich, and isn t impressed. He lost interest when he realized that he could buy his way in.) In the UK, he is arrested on the eve of his sham wedding and repatriated. In all this, Obinze never loses a certain  solidness , that he seems to possess effortlessly, In a democratic Nigeria, where a new middle class is rising, and the money that used to be the preserve of the top army generals starts to filter down, Obinze gets lucky in the way that only happens in Nigeria, where there really is too much money, and overnight he is a very rich man.\n\nWhen Ifemelu starts to hunger for home, Obinze, with whom she has lost touch, is already a husband and father.  Meanwhile o, he has serious money now. See what you missed!  her friend, Ranyinudo tells her on a call from Nigeria. (How Nigerian to say something like that!) The central question becomes, will they get back together? To some, this is a weakness of the story, the descent into the fantasy of a happily-ever-after for the heroine and hero, but it is not such a bad thing in itself - It makes enjoyable, and hopeful reading.\n\nIn summary, I loved the story. I loved the familiarity of it, Ifemelu s mother s ridiculous religiousness, her father's ludicrous use of English, Aunty Uju, Ginika, Kayode, Emenike, who is perhaps one of the more interesting characters, as he strives to shed the life he was born with, to become what he wishes to be, and all the other different kinds of people that make up the rich tapestry that is Nigerian life.\n\nIfemelu is an interesting character, observant, watchful, sure of herself. Even as a teenager, she is confident in a way I wouldn t have understood at that age. Obinze, knows himself in such a way that he doesn t need to follow any crowd, or have anybody validate him. However, I did feel that the ending was rather rushed, as if the author had other things to do, and was hastily putting the final scenes together.\n\nThe main grouse I had with the book was the fact that I saw some elements from Adichie s previous works. When Barrack Obama wins the election and her cousin Dike calls her to say that his president is black like him, I remember an interview long ago where Adichie says that her nephew had said the exact same thing after the elections. It made me feel cheated. This, the similarity of her relationship with Curt to the relationship of the characters in her short story, The Thing Around Your Neck; when Obinze describes his house in Enugu, and I see the house in Birdsong, the scene of another adulterous affair in another of her old short stories. How autobiographical is her work then? I ask myself. I begin to feel suspicious, perhaps all her characters are really herself and the people she knows.\n\nI noticed that apart from Dike, her little cousin, and Obinze, and perhaps Obinze s mother, Ifemelu does not seem very emotionally involved with the people that shape her life. Sometimes she seems like a watcher, an observer, and not a character in the story. Also, because this novel is really many observations and opinions, sometimes it does feel contrived, like a character or event has been introduced solely because they are a means to present an issue Adichie wants to discuss. Lastly, I did not find the blog interesting. Unlike the prose of the novel, the writing is not fluid, or very descriptive, and seems to jump from one issue to another, trying to cram many thoughts into one jumbled package. This may be because I am an NAB, and those issues mean little to me, perhaps the AB s would read it differently.\n\nRegardless, Americanah is a wonderful read, sometimes laugh out loud funny, sometimes sad, but always interesting.\nShow more",

            "content": "One of the best books I've read in 2013. \"Americanah\" is a book of great impact and importance. This is the one book by an African writer that has spoken to me more than any other.\n\nThis is a book about Africa and the African diasporic experience in the USA and England, a backdrop for the love story between Ifemelu and Obinze, teenagers attending a Nigerian university who have to leave the country because of the university strikes in Nigeria. Ifemelu moves to the States, where she attends an American university and starts a blog dealing with race issues in America, while Obinze moves to England and ends up becoming an illegal immigrant.\n\nThe book examines the intricacies of race, especially in the USA, as well as the issue of immigration. It talks about the difference between being black in Africa and being black in the States. Adichie is seamless as she goes from country to country, from American to Nigerian, to Francophone African and English. She is a brilliant writer who gifts us with an entertaining story and introduces us to very real characters.\n\nI found some of the themes discussed in this book similar to those discussed in NoViolet Bulawayo's \"We Need New Names.\" This book helps show that immigrants have it tough; psychological changes, changes to identity, the need to reinvent themselves so that they can  fit in  and be accepted, and so on. Their issues often go unspoken.\n\nAdichie is very aware at the subtleties between cultures and she highlights them well. There were some things that she touched on that I d thought about but never really put in words. For example, people s pity when they realize you re African, and their need to talk about their charitable donations to the continent:\n\n\n\nAdichie isn't shy about bringing up controversial issues, those that others keep silent about. For example, she explores the politics of natural hair among kinky hair:\n\n\n\nOne thing I also loved was the fact that Adichie talked about Africans deciding to return to Africa after having lived abroad. She has Ifemelu saying, \"And yet there was cement in her soul. It had been there for a while, an early morning disease of fatigue, a bleakness, a borderlessness. It brought with it amorphous longings, shapeless desires, brief imaginary glints of other lives she had lived.\"\n\nPerhaps contrary to popular belief, not all Africans in the diaspora are fleeing from Africa; many have questioned what they are doing abroad in the first place and want to move back home. A lot of people do not realize that Africa is growing and developing and that people might actually be happy to live there. Seeing the online communication links between younger people from different African countries makes me feel hopeful that my generation will do great things in the continent.\n\nI love fiction in general but fiction with a message is even more appealing to me. This is a story with such important social commentary. All through the book I had moments in which I said \"It's about time someone addressed that!\"\n\nHighly recommended.\n\n\nShow more",

When I want to buy one that isn t on that list, I achieve a Bare Minimum Requirement of reading a few pages and seeing if I feel ordained to keep going.

The coolest bookstores are open late), I found a chair in a corner under an unseemly pipe, plunked myself down, and started reading.\n\nOver the next hour, a series of quirky college students had loud and performative first dates in a cycle so coordinated it was as if they scheduled it. First two girls yelled about how one of them had seen Panic! at the Disco at a rural gas station. Then a boy and a girl did an intentionally adorable thing where they pointed out the title of a book and tried to guess the plot (this was the girl s idea, and the boy s interest was never more than half-hearted). Then two older women shouted across the shelves about where the children s section was before learning the answer: right f*cking in front of them.\n\nThat last one may not have been a date, but I promise it was equally annoying.\n\nThrough it all, I sat and read this book.\n\nIt wasn t even a comfy chair, or a particularly pleasant room. It was just that good of a book.\n\nMy favorite TED talk (which is a very low bar) has been Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie s  The Danger of a Single Story  since I watched it in a gender class a few years ago. In it, Adichie explains the pervasiveness of stereotypes and bigotry when only one story about a certain group is being told - she uses the story of Africa being a continent of poverty without technology, the only one told in America, as an example.\n\nAfter I watched that talk in that class, and after I got home and watched it again, I should have gone right out and bought everything she d ever written.

            "content": "Warning: I love being part of the crowd, and the crowd is mostly all gushy about this book. But seriously, I wish I had walked away from it. I really wanted to like it, I really did.\n\nThis was the longest book of my life!!! 610 (Kindle) pages that felt like 1,000. I would be reading along and thinking, oh, I m a little bored, let s see how far I ve gotten .and I d look down at the bottom of my Kindle page and see that the progress bar hadn t moved an iota!!! 17 percent, really? I ve read all that, and all you can give me is 17 percent?? Now, the mere fact that I was looking at my progress instead of compulsively turning pages, tells you something. The thing was just too damn long. A tome, a giant, a big bloated blob. Cut it in half, and you might have a deal. Ah, where oh where are my editing scissors?\n\nWhen I first started, I was impressed. Well-drawn, complex characters. Impeccable language. Structurally sound. Keen insights into personalities. All good. I didn t feel this way for long.\n\nAnother plus, one that I m only enjoying in retrospect, is the way the author so clearly shows the cultural differences between Nigeria and America. Adichie is super deft at zooming in on all the bumps that Ifemelu, the main character, feels as she lives as an immigrant in America. She must deal with the black and white conflict and also the African versus black American issue. Through all the confusion and attempts to fit in, Ifemelu faces tough differences in language, habits, viewpoints, and emotions. Ifemelu was sort of snobby and wasn t entirely likable, but I still believed her and felt for her. I usually like analyzing and dissecting a person s actions, motivations, denials, fears, and introspection, but here it was definitely overkill.\n\nAdichie also did a good job of giving us a feel for life in Nigeria; that was the part I liked best. But all of it was painfully, painfully slow.\n\nI m dancing around the worst thing: it s a message book, and I have trouble with preachy. The second half was the worst. Not only did Adichie go overboard with the lectures on racism, she also included a lot of very boring blog posts on racism. The sophomoric lectures put forth obvious ideas, and it annoyed me. I didn t sign up to be a student in Racism 101.\n\nAnd then there s the thing about hair. On the plus side, Ifemelu s obsession with all her hair problems was sometimes funny, sometimes sad, but always engaging. On the minus side of hair, Ifemelu seemed to be too much of an intellectual to be so concerned with how her hair looked. Was that a superficial side of her (and was it believable), or is it just a truth about humans? that we all worry about our appearance, regardless of whether we are intellectuals or not. And we all know that obsessing about how our hair looks is mostly a girl thing, so is it bad press for women?\n\nThe love story, though poignant, was way too drawn out. It was the best part but the shortest part. The last 50 or so pages, when the story heats up the most, were the best. I wanted a plot-driven novel about two star-crossed lovers, and it was far from that.\n\nI can t recommend this book, even though I want to. This kills me, since so many friends absolutely loved it. I must be honest: I never looked forward to picking up this book, which is a deal breaker right there. The bad parts  the preachiness and the excessive length--far outweighed the good parts. A painfully long read. Sorry, all I can say is 2.8.\nShow more",

            "content": "A few weeks ago I read The Thing Around Your Neck, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's short story collection, and was immediately struck with her attention to detail in stories as short as six pages long. Desiring more of her captivating prose, I chose Americanah, her intricate discussion on race in three countries and continents. Taking place in Nigeria, the United States, and England, Americanah can be viewed by many as a novel that is one of the premier looks on race over the last five years.\n\nIfemelu and Obinze met in secondary school in Lagos, Nigeria and even then knew that they were the love of each other's lives. Enjoying a deep relationship often absent in teenaged love, the two attended the same university in Nsukka, where Obinze's mother was a full professor. She welcomed Ifemelu into her family, and the three lived a blissful life that is usually only found in movies. This existence is shattered one day when professors go on extended strikes, denying students their basic right to an education. Ifemelu applies for and receives a Visa to the United States, while Obinze's application is mired in bureaucratic red tape. Although the two are soulmates, they do not see each other for another thirteen years.\n\nIn Nigeria, Adichie explains through Ifemelu, people are blind to race because for the most part everyone looks the same. The second Ifemelu stepped off of the plane in the United States; however, race was everywhere-- from being denied employment even at low level jobs to the way professors talk to her at first, and even the treatment her Aunt Uju, a doctor, receives from prospective employers and the way Uju's son is treated at school. Going from a race blind to a racist country, Ifemelu pines for Obinze and the way things were in Nigeria yet is embarrassed to contact him. Instead, she dates a Caucasian and a African American, two people who she has nothing in common with. Eventually, Ifemelu founds and becomes successful at blogging as a non American black who offers her unique perspective on race to the table. As these blog entries were an aside from the story line, I looked forward to reading them in between chapters in order to glimpse Adichie's gleanings on the race question.\n\nMeanwhile Obinze immigrates to and is later deported from England. There he discovers that he is on the low end of the race totem pole. As dark skinned as he is, his only job prospects are in menial labor that he is over qualified for. Although he thinks of Ifemelu everyday, she does not reach out to him, and the two go on to lead distinct lives. Obinze does not stay in England long as he is deported to Nigeria. After seeing how he had been treated in this supposed western super power, Obinze is happy to return to the comforts of home.\n\nThroughout this novel, Adichie offers a variety of aspects of the race question, especially in Nigeria and the United States where she divides her time. Ifemelu can go from a person who finds one magazine- Essence- where people look like her back to a country where no one questions her because everyone is the for the most part the same skin color. Because this is a novel rather than real life, Adichie ties up all of the plot lines flawlessly even the ones that appear a little far fetched. I enjoyed reading her take on race and look forward to reading her novels set entirely in Nigeria to see if there really exists such a stark contrast on race relations in these two countries. A powerful kick off to African American history month, Americanah earns 5 full stars.\nShow more",

            "content": "\"What is it with you Americans and race?\" my friend Fatima asked me one day over lunch. We were in her country, France, both students at a university tucked in a shadow of an Alpine peak. \"Everyone always wanted to know where I was from. I'd tell them France and they'd say, no, where are you from? It made no sense. I was born in France. I'm French.\" Fatima, with her brown sugar skin and currant-black eyes, then turned to her boyfriend Karim and Arabic poured from her in a river of throaty consonants and chewy vowels.\n\nA few years later, at graduate school in the Midwest, my friend James, a PhD student from Uganda, told me he didn't know he was black until he came to the United States. We were talking about the curious strain in his African Studies graduate program between the African students and the black American students. The term \"African-American\" baffled him. He got it, he understood its history, but it still made little sense to him. They were Americans- not black Americans, not African-Americans, but Americans, full-stop.\n\nRace in America is an uncomfortable subject, mostly for white Americans. We still don't know where to look or what to do with our hands. We fidget and prevaricate, we, like blond-haired, blue-eyed, wealthy, liberal Kimberley in , use euphemisms like \"beautiful\" when we refer to black women so that everyone will know that not only are we not racist, but we think blacks are particularly worthy of our praise. Chimamanda Adichie reflects our beliefs and behaviors back on us, illuminating our silliness and our masquerades, our ignorance and our misguided, but earnest, attempts to the impossible: what it's like to be be something other than white in this very-race conscious society.\n\nThe thing about Adichie's novel is that it's written from a rarified world perspective. There is something very bourgeois about ruminating on race and class from ivory towers, as most of 's characters do. Ifemelu's early years in the United States, when she lives a hand-to-mouth existence as a college student, and her Nigerian boyfriend Obinze's harrowing months in the United Kingdom, from which he is deported as an illegal, give glimpses of how the immigrant experience unfolds in the shadow of racial discrimination. But mostly, this novel is a glossy-magazine conversation between the author and her readers about the experiences of an upper-middle class African woman in America. And I loved it. I loved her voice, her warm and personal style, the way she straddles feminism and social awareness with navel-gazing vanity. I'm not sure if I'm talking about the character Ifemelu or the author Chimamanda Adichie, but the end result is the same. This novel charms at least as much as it educates.\n\nA Washington Post reviewer referred to as social satire. Satire? Really? I didn't get that. I got a very lucid, grounded, contemporary look at race, class, and the immigrant experience in three nations--Nigeria, the United States, and the United Kingdom--built loosely around a love story. Adichie dances a very skilled and entrancing between classic storytelling and social edification.\n\nSatire does foam up in the metafiction blog  Raceteenth or Various Observations About American Blacks (Those Formerly Known as Negroes) by a Non- American Black  written by the protagonist, Ifemelu, a Nigerian woman who comes to the U.S. as a college student. Ifemelu, whose looks and experiences are based on the author's, fills her anonymous blog with stories about the American race and class dilemmas she observes as an outsider. The blog eventually wins her a fellowship at Princeton and her immigrant experience veers into another social track entirely: the liberal elite. Because of her skin color, Ifemelu is pegged as Black and it's assumed she will somehow understand the \"Black\" experience in America. But Ifemelu, like my Ugandan friend James, didn't know from racial distinction until she came to the United States. She makes a decision to guard her Nigerian accent, not to straighten her hair, to make it clear that she is neither Black nor American. She is Nigerian.\n\nAnd after fifteen years in the United States, Ifemelu makes the decision to return to Nigeria, opening herself up to an experience unlike any she'd anticipated: the challenge of rebuilding her identity in a country that has moved on without her. It was a gift for this reader to have an insider's perspective on such a vast, complicated, and fast-changing nation, both before and after Ifemelu and Obinze's separate leave-takings and returns. Adichie takes the narrative many steps beyond most immigrant stories: what happens when you return home, to stay.\n\nI had thought to withhold a star for some of the too-pat romantic relationships Ifemelu wends through and Adichie's sprawling, sometimes self-indulgent style, but I can't. I thought about this book when it wasn't in my hands, I couldn't wait to get back to it, and now, days after completing it, I'm eager to seek out more of Adichie- her writing, her speeches, her essays. I have so much to learn.\n\n\n\nShow more",

Dan received a B.A. in English from Wabash College in 1970, winning a national Phi Beta Kappa Award during his senior year for excellence in fiction, journalism and art.\n\nDan received his Masters in Education from Washington University in St. Louis in 1971. He then worked in elementary education for 18 years 2 years in Missouri, 2 years in Buffalo, New York one year as a specially trained BOCES \"resource teacher\" and another as a sixth-grade teacher and 14 years in Colorado.\n\nABOUT DAN\nBiographic Sketch\n\nHis last four years in teaching were spent creating, coordinating, and teaching in APEX, an extensive gifted/talented program serving 19 elementary schools and some 15,000 potential students. During his years of teaching, he won awards from the Colorado Education Association and was a finalist for the Colorado Teacher of the Year. He also worked as a national language-arts consultant, sharing his own \"Writing Well\" curriculum which he had created for his own classroom. Eleven and twelve-year-old students in Simmons' regular 6th-grade class averaged junior-year in high school writing ability according to annual standardized and holistic writing assessments. Whenever someone says \"writing can't be taught,\" Dan begs to differ and has the track record to prove it. Since becoming a full-time writer, Dan likes to visit college writing classes, has taught in New Hampshire's Odyssey writing program for adults, and is considering hosting his own Windwalker Writers' Workshop.\n\nDan's first published story appeared on Feb. 15, 1982, the day his daughter, Jane Kathryn, was born. He's always attributed that coincidence to \"helping in keeping things in perspective when it comes to the relative importance of writing and life.\"\n\nDan has been a full-time writer since 1987 and lives along the Front Range of Colorado in the same town where he taught for 14 years with his wife, Karen, his daughter, Jane, (when she's home from Hamilton College) and their Pembroke Welsh Corgi, Fergie. He does much of his writing at Windwalker their mountain property and cabin at 8,400 feet of altitude at the base of the Continental Divide, just south of Rocky Mountain National Park. An 8-ft.-tall sculpture of the Shrike a thorned and frightening character from the four Hyperion/Endymion novels was sculpted by an ex-student and friend, Clee Richeson, and the sculpture now stands guard near the isolated cabin."

            "content": "Somehow I ve managed to read a dozen books by Dan Simmons without getting around to Hyperion, one of his most acclaimed works. Frankly, I ve been scared of it. Simmons has been mashing up horror, sci-fi, hard boiled crime novels, thrillers, and historical fiction while often stuffing his books with so many ideas that it was all I could do to keep up so this seemed like it could be a bit more than I could comfortably chew.\n\nJust as I feared, while I was reading and nearing the end, Simmons crept into my house like a ninja and rammed a funnel into my skull. Then he poured his wild sci-fi ideas and concepts into my brain pan like a frat boy pouring the suds in a beer bong. My mind overloaded, and I gibbered like a monkey on meth for fifteen seconds before passing out. When I woke up an hour later with a wicked headache and cerebrospinal fluid leaking out my ears and nose, Simmons was gone, but he d left a note saying\n\nSo now I m typing this with cotton balls stuck in my nostrils and ears while I m waiting to get my MRI scan, and I m once again left in awe of just how many wildly original ideas Simmons can cram into one story.\n\nSimmons borrows the structure of here. In the distant future, humanity has spread out among the stars, and one of the planets they ve inhabited is Hyperion which has the mysterious Time Tombs and a deadly entity known as the Shrike which protects the area around them. A powerful religion has grown around the Shrike and many make pilgrimages to try and see him from which almost no one ever returns.\n\nA former Consul of Hyperion is contacted by the Hegemony government and told that he must join a pilgrimage to see the Shrike with six others. The Ousters, a faction of humanity mutated by centuries of living in deep space, has been making aggressive moves against Hegemony worlds and now they re targeting Hyperion just as there are signs that the empty Time Tombs are about to stop moving backwards in time and finally reveal their secrets.\n\nThe Consul meets the other pilgrims which include a priest, a soldier, a poet, a scholar, a detective and the captain of a rare giant tree capable of space travel. (Yes, a giant tree moving through space. Ask Simmons. I m just reporting the news here, folks.) Realizing that they must have been chosen to make the journey for a reason, they take turns telling the stories of their connections to Hyperion and the Shrike as they make their way towards the Time Tombs.\n\nI struggled with this book at first because Simmons throws the readers into the deep end of the pool with little explanation of the universe he s created, and I don t do well with books that start like:   \n\nFortunately, Simmons gets the plot up and moving quickly, and then uses the stories of each of the pilgrims to fill us in on the history and setting. By using the different story tellers, Simmons gives different perspectives for tales as diverse as an interstellar war to a future detective story with big sci-fi action to quieter personal tragedies like a father losing his daughter to a horrible fate. All of these stories eventually come back around to Hyperion and the Shrike.\n\nI was also impressed how Simmons writing this in 1989 foresaw a computer network linking people, but also turning them into information overloaded cyber junkies who confuse accumulating news with taking action. There s so many different big sci-fi ideas in here that many writers probably would have been content to make an entire career out them, but Simmons uses them all deftly to create one unified story. Oh, and memo to George Lucas: the next time you want to make a sci-fi movie with interplanetary politics being a primary driver to your plot, read this first. Or just hire Simmons to write the damn thing for you .\n\nMy only gripe is that while I knew there were sequels to this, I thought I was getting a complete story, and it definitely leaves a lot hanging for the next book. And there s a thing near the end, and I hate the goddamn . It s a Kansas thing.\nShow more",

            "content": "I had to be in the right frame of mind to read this book. Basically, it is The Canterbury Tales in space. Seven pilgrims set out on a potentially fatal one-way trip to visit the Time Tombs on the planet of Hyperion, where a godlike killing machine called the Shrike will possibly grant one of them a wish -- and probably slaughter the rest.\n\nYou have to have some patience, and be willing to change your focus from character to character, as each takes their turn telling the story of what has brought them to this pilgrimage. The novel is thus a collection of interconnected novellas with a common frame narrative. Each character's story is gripping, fascinating, chill-inducing. Each is worth the price of admission and offers clues to the puzzle of the Time Tombs and the Shrike. But for me, anyway, it can sometimes be tough to become attached to one narrator and then have to change to another. This is no knock on Simmons. His narrative is beautifully written, and once I was about halfway into the book, I couldn't stop reading. The payoff is totally worth it, as each story unfolds another facet of this incredible universe Simmons has created. It is a pilgrimage that is worth the journey -- and the book leaves us at a perfect cliffhanger, with the stories all told, the stakes raised, the mystery about to be confronted once and for all . . . but still no answers. And that's why I am buying the sequel right now!\nShow more",

            "content": "My 600th review goes to Hyperion, an imaginative and magnificent classic science fiction novel.\n\nAfter years of having Hyperion by Dan Simmons on my TBR, I can finally say that I ve read this beloved classic sci-fi novel. Before I started reading this novel, I didn t know much about the premise or the content of the Hyperion except that there s this creature called The Shrike in it, and also this book or series is one of the most beloved and highly praised sci-fi novels of all time. I m actually pretty shocked that was first published in 1989. This felt like a book written way ahead of its time, and I m not surprised this has become a classic now. has been on my TBR pile for almost 6 years, and because I ve been missing sci-fi a lot lately, I thought I might as well read this series now, and I m definitely not disappointed by the first installment of the series.\n\n\n\nis the first book in the quartet by Dan Simmons. On the world called Hyperion, beyond the reach of galactic law, there waits a creature called the Shrike. There are those who worship it. There are those who fear it. And there are those who have vowed to destroy it. In the Valley of the Time Tombs, where huge, brooding structures move backward through time, the Shrike waits for them all. On the eve of Armageddon, with the entire galaxy at war, seven pilgrims set forth on a final voyage to Hyperion seeking the answers to the unsolved riddles of their lives. Each carries a desperate hope and a terrible secret.\n\nAs many reviews have stated, is like in space. It is essentially seven novellas in one novel, and it s different from the majority of novels I ve read so far. I didn t know that I would be reading six different tales told by each individual, and this can be a hit or miss because it feels like a collection of novellas. It did take me some time to get used to the narrative structure. My degree of likeness with each story differs, but I loved how each one of the stories shed utterly important revelations regarding Hyperion and the ominous creature called The Shrike. So, my review will consist of my brief thoughts regarding each tale in .\n\n\n\n\nThis is the tale about Father Hoyt and mostly Father Dure. The Priest's Tale is the first story told by the pilgrims embarking upon Hyperion. And I think the ending of this tale could easily be the make-or-break moment for the reader. As I said, I did not know what kind of book was, and reading the tale of Father Dure being told in the form of a diary took me some time to get used to. I wondered, where is this story going? What is the purpose of this tale? And when I neared the end of the chapter, my jaw dropped. What happened to the Priests was insanely terrifying and impactful. The Priest's Tale allowed Simmons to inform his readers immediately that will be a bleak tale. The theme of faith was elaborated carefully, and we get to find that The Shrike is not the only creature that should be feared; there are more. I loved this one, and I consider The Priest's Tale my third favorite tale in the novel.\n\n\n\n\nIf I were told to sum up The Soldier's Tale in three words, it would be blood, war, and sex. The Soldier's Tale tells Kassad's fight against the Ousters and the important reason why he wants to go to Hyperion. Overall, I did not love this story as much as The Priest's Tale. But seeing more glimpses of what The Shrike is capable of here totally mesmerized me. By this stage of the narrative, I already thought of The Shrike as one of the scariest creatures in science fiction, and reading the book further just proved that notion more. I rank The Soldier's Tale as my fourth favorite tale in .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI really loved The Poet's Tale. The third tale in this book is told from Martin Silenus's POV, and the depiction of writing, poetry, art, and what it means to become a writer was so profound. Out of all the Tales in , this was the one that made me highlight so many passages. Simmons successfully put many thought-provoking and resonating passages without making them a hindrance to the pacing. The revelations about The Shrike revealed in this tale were so mind-blowing to me, and I can't wait to find out whether it's all true or not. The Poet's Tale is my second favorite tale in the book.\n\n\n\n\nThis is it. The Scholar's Tale is my favorite tale in the entire novel. It's probably the most different compared to the other stories, but by putting the extraordinary circumstances in ordinary lives, Simmons effectively made The Scholar's Tale, the fourth story, the most heartbreaking and powerful tale to read. I read this long chapter in one sitting. I just couldn't put it down. Family and parenthood are the key themes of this tale, and once again, the gradual sadness caused by the unstoppable passage of time was incredibly well-written. It is a poignant tale, one that will make you sit and think, and it's so worth your time to read.\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, after the greatness of The Poet's Tale and The Scholar's Tale, this tale just felt so tame in comparison. The fifth Tale is a murder mystery story, and it's my second least favorite in . It's one of the longest chapters in the book, I couldn't feel invested in the love story, and it's disappointing that it doesn't add many big revelations regarding The Shrike or Hyperion.\n\n\n\n\nEven more unfortunate, the final Tale in the book is definitely my least favorite Tale in the entire book. I don't have anything much to offer here. I didn't find anything told in this Tale to be memorable, and similar to The Detective's Tale, it didn't add many revelations regarding The Shrike or Hyperion. I keep saying this as a criticism because, to me, the big pieces of revelations provided on The Shrike in the first four Tales are what made their respective ending so impactful and memorable.\n\n\n\nThe quote above is pretty much what you can expect from the ending of . I haven't done my research on this, so I can't confirm whether this is true or not, but the abrupt ending might mean that and its sequel was one big book divided into two novels due to its length. If I were to rate based on the first four Tales I read, I'd rate it with a 5/5 stars rating. It's a shame that the final two tales just didn't click with me, and I have to lower my rating. That being said, even though I didn't like the last two Tales, Dan Simmons has shown his versatility as a writer so damn well with all the Tales told in . I am very much looking forward to reading next month. I need to find out how this grand setup will be concluded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more",

A timeless milestone, something that should make him immediately be named in one row with the big three, Asimov, Clarke, and Lem. Sorry, Heinlein and Dick, you never achieved to reach their level.

            "content": "First of all, let me begin by saying that I really enjoyed reading Hyperion by Dan Simmons.\n\nThe depth, variety and scope of his imagination is a joy for any science fiction fan. Having said that, there were some flaws that must be addressed. The dialogue is frequently flat and there are some corny stereotypes that were fun but also distracting when the writer is trying to create a serious work. The pace is also a problem. I had to invoke my rule to give any book at least 100 pages before I set it aside. It was not just that the narrative was slow, but Simmons takes the reader for granted in the first quarter of the book, trusting that he will be able to keep the reader s attention. It was not until the halfway mark that I really began to buy what Simmons was selling.\n\nAlso frustrating is the thematic trend of science fiction and fantasy writers to write a series, to which Simmons subscribes. This book is entertaining and enjoyable but is clearly meant to begin a series, the denouement is posted somewhere after the back cover. This is not necessarily wrong or a problem all by itself, but I do think it adds to a book to stand on its own. Certainly there are great series and books that are meant to be a part of a series, but as an artistic achievement and for literary significance, a novel should be able to be its own story, even if it is a part of a larger chronicle.\n\nThat said, Hyperion is a fun, smart book. Structured along the lines of Chaucer s and with frequent literary references, especially to John Keats, this is well written and compelling. Another fundamental aspect of a good science fiction book is the ability to illustrate a future setting. Simmons use of the Chaucer template allows him to explore several different settings in the future universe he has created, and it is a very good universe, reminiscent of Clarke, Asimov and Heinlein in its detail. And I will read the next book in the series, Sam I Am, with a fox and in a box, because Simmons has created a very good book in Hyperion that will probably continue to be good as a series.\n\n** A year later and I still have not read the second book, still mad about the ending\n\n** Years later and I still have not read more, still mad about the ending\n\n** Ok six years later and I am reading the sequel.\n\nShow more",

            "content": "WHAT THE SHRIKE!\n\nWhat in the world did I just read, and why didn't I read it sooner? This book is so superbly written and crafted it's easily one of the best modern books I've read, one that excels in storytelling and writing!\n\nIf I could give this book more than five stars, I definitely, definitely would.\n\nThe scope of imagination, wordplay, and critical analysis of humankind is astounding. I do think that the \"frame\" structure of the story, in which each character's tale slowly unfurls the plot, is superbly done. Each following story added a significant layer of depth to the book.\n\nI don't know if I can contribute any more than what has already been said about this book, so here are some of my reactions for each tale.\n\n[MINOR SPOILERS FROM HERE ON END, though nothing that would devastate many expectations.  ]\n\n---\n--\n-\n\n1. : I never really thought a series of a few words would ever cause me to break out in goose bumps. Not even \"Come play with us, Danny\" or \"Hello, Clarice\" or even \"We know how monetary policy works\" has elicited such a reaction. The priest's tale was powerful a delicate mixture of horror and cleansing salvation. Even after finishing the book, I feel that the other stories don't match up to the urgency and suspense of the priest's tale.\n\nWelcome to the rabbit hole that is Hyperion.\n\n2. : This tale reached impressive heights in the beauty of its prose, and the irony of its conclusion. To put it crudely, the twist at the end of this story would probably top the episode charts of , if Ashton Kutcher survived till the rise of the Hegemony. The story alternated between beautiful especially when Kassad meets his special someone for the first time in person and what I can only describe with a very impassioned and dizzied WTFJUSTHAPPENED. I listened to Kassad's entire story on audiobook. The narrator had the perfect voice for a hard military man like Kassad who is lost in love.\n\n3. : Ah, this was probably my favorite story of them all. The potty-mouthed, frat house humor of this story, especially after Kassad's nostalgic and passionate tale, was a refreshing change. In my mind, M. Silenus was one of the most developed characters of the book, with the exception of Sol Weintraub. Seriously, some days, I wish I could respond to queries M. Silenus-style: \"Goddamn poopoo.\" The winding yet always focused narrative of M. Silenus was perfect in its execution just circuitous enough to get into the \"mad poet\" mindset, but told with enough purpose to direct us along in its torrential journey to the final conclusion.\n\n4. : This was a well told, emotional story. It didn't affect me as much as it did other people, probably because I was more in the position of Rachel than Sol. Still, this story was the most approachable in plot and superbly crafted.\n\n5. : I haven't read many \"whodunit\" type of novels, and have never read any PI novels. You know, the ones where the PI is some grizzled chain-smoking guy that sports a thick trench coat and a tattered pork pie hat. [I'm aware I am massively stereotyping, or that I may have gotten the stereotype wrong... Please don't hurt me, I'm sorry!] The twist in this one is that the PI is a woman, and the person who steps into her office is a young, beautiful man with a very unusual secret. It took me a while to get into the story; Brawne Lamia isn't my favorite character. But it took off after a while, and the ending was satisfying, if not a little confusing.\n\n6. : Well, that came out of nowhere.\n\n-\n--\n---\n\nAs a sci-fi newbie, I had some trouble swallowing down the futuristic elements, especially since the story throws you right into the heat of things. Unfamiliar terms made me nervous (Time debt? Fatline? Senate CEO? Huh?!) and may have pushed me into early retirement from the book if not for the rave reviews. To be honest, I still don t completely understand this new world that we re thrust into. But this is a story-driven narrative, and the stories that we re given are well worth the entry into a brave, new, world.\n\nEIGHT BAZILLION STARS AND THE HIGHEST OF RECOMMENDATIONS!\nShow more",

            "content": "Posted at Heradas Review\n\nThis is another one of those classics of SF literature that I have somehow missed reading over the years. Had I been more of an active reader in the nineties, I m sure I would ve come to it much sooner. Thankfully, I finally got there, and Hyperion was not what I expected, in the best way possible. It s most often compared to Dune, The Book of the New Sun, or other great works of Science Fantasy. Obviously, coming into the novel my expectations were high, and I knew the most basic gist of the plot: a pilgrimage across a world to meet an unimaginable being. What I got was partly what I anticipated, but in a very left-field form, which was such a refreshing subversion of my what I thought I was getting myself into. It delivered on what I thought it was, but in a way I never imagined, and it was fantastic.\n\nInstead of straight-forward narrative momentum, Hyperion is almost entirely the backstories of these pilgrims. It s heavily character based, and the only book I can honestly say is 100% both a novel, and a story collection. These stories are more technically novellas, because of their length, but you get what I m saying. Each story genuinely adds to the forward narrative, by going backward. It s really quite breathtaking to see this done so well. I ve read other collections that are also novels, but they re always more one or the other. This is equally both.\n\nEach tale feels like a slightly different genre married to science fiction, and the interstitial sections weave them together tightly. Only one of them fell slightly flat for me. Mostly because it was more akin to cyberpunk than anything else, and I have a real love/hate affair with cyberpunk. I tend to judge the genre entirely too harshly at times, mostly because if I have any sort of professional knowledge, it s in the Information Technology arena, and I have a difficult time suspending my disbelief about the realities of virtual worlds in regards to how they re represented in cyberpunk. That s a topic for another day.\n\nHyperion has that indescribable, almost lovecraftian terror, dread and brooding present throughout, and one tale in particular left me unbearably heartbroken. There s honestly only one thing I can objectively complain about here, and it s more endemic to the genre during the time period this was written in than anything else: the way the narrator spends an inordinate amount of time describing women s bodies, broken down into parts, particularly breasts and nipples. It s just kind of eye-roll pervy, but it s my only real gripe. Thankfully, it s not quite at a level, and this doesn t much happen anymore in the really well written stuff of the genre, but I m more embarrassed for the author than anything else, award winning fiction like this is fairly written in stone for future generations to examine.\n\nI was torn whether or not to dig straight into after finishing this, but ultimately I decided not to just yet. I want to let this percolate and grow in my mind, but mostly I m one of those anti-bingeing types that prefers to spread great stories out over a long period of time, to elongate my enjoyment of them, and better unpack their themes. I think it s time for a non-genre novel, and then I ll dig back in when the time is right. That being said, I can t wait to come back to the world of Hyperion, and see what new terrors await these fantastic characters.\nShow more",

            "content": "Somehow I ve managed to read a dozen books by Dan Simmons without getting around to Hyperion, one of his most acclaimed works. Frankly, I ve been scared of it. Simmons has been mashing up horror, sci-fi, hard boiled crime novels, thrillers, and historical fiction while often stuffing his books with so many ideas that it was all I could do to keep up so this seemed like it could be a bit more than I could comfortably chew.\n\nJust as I feared, while I was reading and nearing the end, Simmons crept into my house like a ninja and rammed a funnel into my skull. Then he poured his wild sci-fi ideas and concepts into my brain pan like a frat boy pouring the suds in a beer bong. My mind overloaded, and I gibbered like a monkey on meth for fifteen seconds before passing out. When I woke up an hour later with a wicked headache and cerebrospinal fluid leaking out my ears and nose, Simmons was gone, but he d left a note saying\n\nSo now I m typing this with cotton balls stuck in my nostrils and ears while I m waiting to get my MRI scan, and I m once again left in awe of just how many wildly original ideas Simmons can cram into one story.\n\nSimmons borrows the structure of here. In the distant future, humanity has spread out among the stars, and one of the planets they ve inhabited is Hyperion which has the mysterious Time Tombs and a deadly entity known as the Shrike which protects the area around them. A powerful religion has grown around the Shrike and many make pilgrimages to try and see him from which almost no one ever returns.\n\nA former Consul of Hyperion is contacted by the Hegemony government and told that he must join a pilgrimage to see the Shrike with six others. The Ousters, a faction of humanity mutated by centuries of living in deep space, has been making aggressive moves against Hegemony worlds and now they re targeting Hyperion just as there are signs that the empty Time Tombs are about to stop moving backwards in time and finally reveal their secrets.\n\nThe Consul meets the other pilgrims which include a priest, a soldier, a poet, a scholar, a detective and the captain of a rare giant tree capable of space travel. (Yes, a giant tree moving through space. Ask Simmons. I m just reporting the news here, folks.) Realizing that they must have been chosen to make the journey for a reason, they take turns telling the stories of their connections to Hyperion and the Shrike as they make their way towards the Time Tombs.\n\nI struggled with this book at first because Simmons throws the readers into the deep end of the pool with little explanation of the universe he s created, and I don t do well with books that start like:   \n\nFortunately, Simmons gets the plot up and moving quickly, and then uses the stories of each of the pilgrims to fill us in on the history and setting. By using the different story tellers, Simmons gives different perspectives for tales as diverse as an interstellar war to a future detective story with big sci-fi action to quieter personal tragedies like a father losing his daughter to a horrible fate. All of these stories eventually come back around to Hyperion and the Shrike.\n\nI was also impressed how Simmons writing this in 1989 foresaw a computer network linking people, but also turning them into information overloaded cyber junkies who confuse accumulating news with taking action. There s so many different big sci-fi ideas in here that many writers probably would have been content to make an entire career out them, but Simmons uses them all deftly to create one unified story. Oh, and memo to George Lucas: the next time you want to make a sci-fi movie with interplanetary politics being a primary driver to your plot, read this first. Or just hire Simmons to write the damn thing for you .\n\nMy only gripe is that while I knew there were sequels to this, I thought I was getting a complete story, and it definitely leaves a lot hanging for the next book. And there s a thing near the end, and I hate the goddamn . It s a Kansas thing.\nShow more",

Seven pilgrims set out on a potentially fatal one-way trip to visit the Time Tombs on the planet of Hyperion, where a godlike killing machine called the Shrike will possibly grant one of them a wish -- and probably slaughter the rest.\n\nYou have to have some patience, and be willing to change your focus from character to character, as each takes their turn telling the story of what has brought them to this pilgrimage. The novel is thus a collection of interconnected novellas with a common frame narrative. Each character's story is gripping, fascinating, chill-inducing. Each is worth the price of admission and offers clues to the puzzle of the Time Tombs and the Shrike. But for me, anyway, it can sometimes be tough to become attached to one narrator and then have to change to another. This is no knock on Simmons. His narrative is beautifully written, and once I was about halfway into the book, I couldn't stop reading. The payoff is totally worth it, as each story unfolds another facet of this incredible universe Simmons has created. It is a pilgrimage that is worth the journey -- and the book leaves us at a perfect cliffhanger, with the stories all told, the stakes raised, the mystery about to be confronted once and for all . . . but still no answers.

            "content": "My 600th review goes to Hyperion, an imaginative and magnificent classic science fiction novel.\n\nAfter years of having Hyperion by Dan Simmons on my TBR, I can finally say that I ve read this beloved classic sci-fi novel. Before I started reading this novel, I didn t know much about the premise or the content of the Hyperion except that there s this creature called The Shrike in it, and also this book or series is one of the most beloved and highly praised sci-fi novels of all time. I m actually pretty shocked that was first published in 1989. This felt like a book written way ahead of its time, and I m not surprised this has become a classic now. has been on my TBR pile for almost 6 years, and because I ve been missing sci-fi a lot lately, I thought I might as well read this series now, and I m definitely not disappointed by the first installment of the series.\n\n\n\nis the first book in the quartet by Dan Simmons. On the world called Hyperion, beyond the reach of galactic law, there waits a creature called the Shrike. There are those who worship it. There are those who fear it. And there are those who have vowed to destroy it. In the Valley of the Time Tombs, where huge, brooding structures move backward through time, the Shrike waits for them all. On the eve of Armageddon, with the entire galaxy at war, seven pilgrims set forth on a final voyage to Hyperion seeking the answers to the unsolved riddles of their lives. Each carries a desperate hope and a terrible secret.\n\nAs many reviews have stated, is like in space. It is essentially seven novellas in one novel, and it s different from the majority of novels I ve read so far. I didn t know that I would be reading six different tales told by each individual, and this can be a hit or miss because it feels like a collection of novellas. It did take me some time to get used to the narrative structure. My degree of likeness with each story differs, but I loved how each one of the stories shed utterly important revelations regarding Hyperion and the ominous creature called The Shrike. So, my review will consist of my brief thoughts regarding each tale in .\n\n\n\n\nThis is the tale about Father Hoyt and mostly Father Dure. The Priest's Tale is the first story told by the pilgrims embarking upon Hyperion. And I think the ending of this tale could easily be the make-or-break moment for the reader. As I said, I did not know what kind of book was, and reading the tale of Father Dure being told in the form of a diary took me some time to get used to. I wondered, where is this story going? What is the purpose of this tale? And when I neared the end of the chapter, my jaw dropped. What happened to the Priests was insanely terrifying and impactful. The Priest's Tale allowed Simmons to inform his readers immediately that will be a bleak tale. The theme of faith was elaborated carefully, and we get to find that The Shrike is not the only creature that should be feared; there are more. I loved this one, and I consider The Priest's Tale my third favorite tale in the novel.\n\n\n\n\nIf I were told to sum up The Soldier's Tale in three words, it would be blood, war, and sex. The Soldier's Tale tells Kassad's fight against the Ousters and the important reason why he wants to go to Hyperion. Overall, I did not love this story as much as The Priest's Tale. But seeing more glimpses of what The Shrike is capable of here totally mesmerized me. By this stage of the narrative, I already thought of The Shrike as one of the scariest creatures in science fiction, and reading the book further just proved that notion more. I rank The Soldier's Tale as my fourth favorite tale in .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI really loved The Poet's Tale. The third tale in this book is told from Martin Silenus's POV, and the depiction of writing, poetry, art, and what it means to become a writer was so profound. Out of all the Tales in , this was the one that made me highlight so many passages. Simmons successfully put many thought-provoking and resonating passages without making them a hindrance to the pacing. The revelations about The Shrike revealed in this tale were so mind-blowing to me, and I can't wait to find out whether it's all true or not. The Poet's Tale is my second favorite tale in the book.\n\n\n\n\nThis is it. The Scholar's Tale is my favorite tale in the entire novel. It's probably the most different compared to the other stories, but by putting the extraordinary circumstances in ordinary lives, Simmons effectively made The Scholar's Tale, the fourth story, the most heartbreaking and powerful tale to read. I read this long chapter in one sitting. I just couldn't put it down. Family and parenthood are the key themes of this tale, and once again, the gradual sadness caused by the unstoppable passage of time was incredibly well-written. It is a poignant tale, one that will make you sit and think, and it's so worth your time to read.\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, after the greatness of The Poet's Tale and The Scholar's Tale, this tale just felt so tame in comparison. The fifth Tale is a murder mystery story, and it's my second least favorite in . It's one of the longest chapters in the book, I couldn't feel invested in the love story, and it's disappointing that it doesn't add many big revelations regarding The Shrike or Hyperion.\n\n\n\n\nEven more unfortunate, the final Tale in the book is definitely my least favorite Tale in the entire book. I don't have anything much to offer here. I didn't find anything told in this Tale to be memorable, and similar to The Detective's Tale, it didn't add many revelations regarding The Shrike or Hyperion. I keep saying this as a criticism because, to me, the big pieces of revelations provided on The Shrike in the first four Tales are what made their respective ending so impactful and memorable.\n\n\n\nThe quote above is pretty much what you can expect from the ending of . I haven't done my research on this, so I can't confirm whether this is true or not, but the abrupt ending might mean that and its sequel was one big book divided into two novels due to its length. If I were to rate based on the first four Tales I read, I'd rate it with a 5/5 stars rating. It's a shame that the final two tales just didn't click with me, and I have to lower my rating. That being said, even though I didn't like the last two Tales, Dan Simmons has shown his versatility as a writer so damn well with all the Tales told in . I am very much looking forward to reading next month. I need to find out how this grand setup will be concluded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more",

A timeless milestone, something that should make him immediately be named in one row with the big three, Asimov, Clarke, and Lem. Sorry, Heinlein and Dick, you never achieved to reach their level.

            "content": "First of all, let me begin by saying that I really enjoyed reading Hyperion by Dan Simmons.\n\nThe depth, variety and scope of his imagination is a joy for any science fiction fan. Having said that, there were some flaws that must be addressed. The dialogue is frequently flat and there are some corny stereotypes that were fun but also distracting when the writer is trying to create a serious work. The pace is also a problem. I had to invoke my rule to give any book at least 100 pages before I set it aside. It was not just that the narrative was slow, but Simmons takes the reader for granted in the first quarter of the book, trusting that he will be able to keep the reader s attention. It was not until the halfway mark that I really began to buy what Simmons was selling.\n\nAlso frustrating is the thematic trend of science fiction and fantasy writers to write a series, to which Simmons subscribes. This book is entertaining and enjoyable but is clearly meant to begin a series, the denouement is posted somewhere after the back cover. This is not necessarily wrong or a problem all by itself, but I do think it adds to a book to stand on its own. Certainly there are great series and books that are meant to be a part of a series, but as an artistic achievement and for literary significance, a novel should be able to be its own story, even if it is a part of a larger chronicle.\n\nThat said, Hyperion is a fun, smart book. Structured along the lines of Chaucer s and with frequent literary references, especially to John Keats, this is well written and compelling. Another fundamental aspect of a good science fiction book is the ability to illustrate a future setting. Simmons use of the Chaucer template allows him to explore several different settings in the future universe he has created, and it is a very good universe, reminiscent of Clarke, Asimov and Heinlein in its detail. And I will read the next book in the series, Sam I Am, with a fox and in a box, because Simmons has created a very good book in Hyperion that will probably continue to be good as a series.\n\n** A year later and I still have not read the second book, still mad about the ending\n\n** Years later and I still have not read more, still mad about the ending\n\n** Ok six years later and I am reading the sequel.\n\nShow more",

            "content": "WHAT THE SHRIKE!\n\nWhat in the world did I just read, and why didn't I read it sooner? This book is so superbly written and crafted it's easily one of the best modern books I've read, one that excels in storytelling and writing!\n\nIf I could give this book more than five stars, I definitely, definitely would.\n\nThe scope of imagination, wordplay, and critical analysis of humankind is astounding. I do think that the \"frame\" structure of the story, in which each character's tale slowly unfurls the plot, is superbly done. Each following story added a significant layer of depth to the book.\n\nI don't know if I can contribute any more than what has already been said about this book, so here are some of my reactions for each tale.\n\n[MINOR SPOILERS FROM HERE ON END, though nothing that would devastate many expectations.  ]\n\n---\n--\n-\n\n1. : I never really thought a series of a few words would ever cause me to break out in goose bumps. Not even \"Come play with us, Danny\" or \"Hello, Clarice\" or even \"We know how monetary policy works\" has elicited such a reaction. The priest's tale was powerful a delicate mixture of horror and cleansing salvation. Even after finishing the book, I feel that the other stories don't match up to the urgency and suspense of the priest's tale.\n\nWelcome to the rabbit hole that is Hyperion.\n\n2. : This tale reached impressive heights in the beauty of its prose, and the irony of its conclusion. To put it crudely, the twist at the end of this story would probably top the episode charts of , if Ashton Kutcher survived till the rise of the Hegemony. The story alternated between beautiful especially when Kassad meets his special someone for the first time in person and what I can only describe with a very impassioned and dizzied WTFJUSTHAPPENED. I listened to Kassad's entire story on audiobook. The narrator had the perfect voice for a hard military man like Kassad who is lost in love.\n\n3. : Ah, this was probably my favorite story of them all. The potty-mouthed, frat house humor of this story, especially after Kassad's nostalgic and passionate tale, was a refreshing change. In my mind, M. Silenus was one of the most developed characters of the book, with the exception of Sol Weintraub. Seriously, some days, I wish I could respond to queries M. Silenus-style: \"Goddamn poopoo.\" The winding yet always focused narrative of M. Silenus was perfect in its execution just circuitous enough to get into the \"mad poet\" mindset, but told with enough purpose to direct us along in its torrential journey to the final conclusion.\n\n4. : This was a well told, emotional story. It didn't affect me as much as it did other people, probably because I was more in the position of Rachel than Sol. Still, this story was the most approachable in plot and superbly crafted.\n\n5. : I haven't read many \"whodunit\" type of novels, and have never read any PI novels. You know, the ones where the PI is some grizzled chain-smoking guy that sports a thick trench coat and a tattered pork pie hat. [I'm aware I am massively stereotyping, or that I may have gotten the stereotype wrong... Please don't hurt me, I'm sorry!] The twist in this one is that the PI is a woman, and the person who steps into her office is a young, beautiful man with a very unusual secret. It took me a while to get into the story; Brawne Lamia isn't my favorite character. But it took off after a while, and the ending was satisfying, if not a little confusing.\n\n6. : Well, that came out of nowhere.\n\n-\n--\n---\n\nAs a sci-fi newbie, I had some trouble swallowing down the futuristic elements, especially since the story throws you right into the heat of things. Unfamiliar terms made me nervous (Time debt? Fatline? Senate CEO? Huh?!) and may have pushed me into early retirement from the book if not for the rave reviews. To be honest, I still don t completely understand this new world that we re thrust into. But this is a story-driven narrative, and the stories that we re given are well worth the entry into a brave, new, world.\n\nEIGHT BAZILLION STARS AND THE HIGHEST OF RECOMMENDATIONS!\nShow more",

            "content": "Posted at Heradas Review\n\nThis is another one of those classics of SF literature that I have somehow missed reading over the years. Had I been more of an active reader in the nineties, I m sure I would ve come to it much sooner. Thankfully, I finally got there, and Hyperion was not what I expected, in the best way possible. It s most often compared to Dune, The Book of the New Sun, or other great works of Science Fantasy. Obviously, coming into the novel my expectations were high, and I knew the most basic gist of the plot: a pilgrimage across a world to meet an unimaginable being. What I got was partly what I anticipated, but in a very left-field form, which was such a refreshing subversion of my what I thought I was getting myself into. It delivered on what I thought it was, but in a way I never imagined, and it was fantastic.\n\nInstead of straight-forward narrative momentum, Hyperion is almost entirely the backstories of these pilgrims. It s heavily character based, and the only book I can honestly say is 100% both a novel, and a story collection. These stories are more technically novellas, because of their length, but you get what I m saying. Each story genuinely adds to the forward narrative, by going backward. It s really quite breathtaking to see this done so well. I ve read other collections that are also novels, but they re always more one or the other. This is equally both.\n\nEach tale feels like a slightly different genre married to science fiction, and the interstitial sections weave them together tightly. Only one of them fell slightly flat for me. Mostly because it was more akin to cyberpunk than anything else, and I have a real love/hate affair with cyberpunk. I tend to judge the genre entirely too harshly at times, mostly because if I have any sort of professional knowledge, it s in the Information Technology arena, and I have a difficult time suspending my disbelief about the realities of virtual worlds in regards to how they re represented in cyberpunk. That s a topic for another day.\n\nHyperion has that indescribable, almost lovecraftian terror, dread and brooding present throughout, and one tale in particular left me unbearably heartbroken. There s honestly only one thing I can objectively complain about here, and it s more endemic to the genre during the time period this was written in than anything else: the way the narrator spends an inordinate amount of time describing women s bodies, broken down into parts, particularly breasts and nipples. It s just kind of eye-roll pervy, but it s my only real gripe. Thankfully, it s not quite at a level, and this doesn t much happen anymore in the really well written stuff of the genre, but I m more embarrassed for the author than anything else, award winning fiction like this is fairly written in stone for future generations to examine.\n\nI was torn whether or not to dig straight into after finishing this, but ultimately I decided not to just yet. I want to let this percolate and grow in my mind, but mostly I m one of those anti-bingeing types that prefers to spread great stories out over a long period of time, to elongate my enjoyment of them, and better unpack their themes. I think it s time for a non-genre novel, and then I ll dig back in when the time is right. That being said, I can t wait to come back to the world of Hyperion, and see what new terrors await these fantastic characters.\nShow more",

            "content": "When asked if I would buddy read this Tom Clancy classic, I jumped at the chance. While the book s title was familiar to me, I have to admit that I have never taken the time to read any of Clancy s work. This was a sensational Cold War thriller, with all the key elements to keep patient readers on the edge of their seats. When a well-armed Russian nuclear submarine is on its way to the East Coast of the United States, few know that its captain has plans to defect. After the Russians learn this, they hope to stop things quickly and recover their prized maritime weapon. The Americans are privy to this through a leak in the Soviet government, but do not wish to tip their hand. Now, it s a matter of getting the captain and his crew safely into the hands of the Americans, while capturing the submarine, all before the Russians learn of the plan. It s sure to be a race, as both sides stare one another down and hope not to push the world to the brink of war on the high seas. A great introduction to Clancy s world for anyone with time and patience to dedicate to this novel.\n\nIn the bleak North Atlantic, the Red October, a Soviet submarine with exceptional firepower, inches closer to the East Coast of the United States. It s mission is not entirely clear, but the payload aboard could cause havoc in the blink of an eye. The Cold War may be a period of detente, but all that could change quickly.\n\nCaptain Mario Ramius is guiding Red October on its mission, stealthily crossing the Atlantic with hopes of making landfall before too long. However, Ramius has a secret, one that he has not shared with many. He wishes to defect and is happy to take his crew with him. While his family has strong ties to Soviet Russia, he cannot stomach the direction in which his government is taking the nation and has high hopes of living freely in America.\n\nWhile the Russians have been made aware of this, they must act carefully. They need to get Ramius and Red October back before anyone is aware of what is going on. All the while, the Americans have been tipped off to what s going on and have plans to help Ramius and get their hands on Red October, as well as all it holds. This will allow them a better idea of Soviet technology and submarine advancements.\n\nTrying to play it cool, both sides send ships into the open waters, in hopes of keeping things somewhat light and discreet. This includes a CIA operative, Dr. Jack Ryan, whose background in naval history will help the Americans on their mission. Ryan has not served and is not keen to be pulled into this battle, but knows that he must serve his country as best he can. Armed with an academic s mind, Ryan will have to attempt to inform the higher-ups as the Soviet ships inch closer.\n\nWhile both sides are calm on the surface, it s a panic to locate Red October and bring her in. Ramius is becoming more worried as the days pass, wondering if his plan will work, or whether he will be captured and sent to the gulags. The Americans are keen to get their hands on the technology and will do whatever it takes to get their hands on it, even if that means sacrificing some of their own.\n\nWhen things come to a head, it s a political stare down like no other, pitting American freedom against Soviet order. Neither side is keen to open the proverbial can of worms, but possession of the Red October is essential and must be achieved. The hunt for this submarine could push the world to the brink, though no one is blinking quite yet. A chilling Cold War tale that had me turning pages and wondering what was to come. Clancy has me intrigued and I will surely be back to discover more!\n\nWhile I am aware of Tom Clancy and how Hollywood got their hands on his books to turn them into feature films, there was never a push for me to read the vast collection. I love espionage and Cold War stories, but always shied away, as I have little knowledge of anything marine related. I was told the book was which technical in places and worried that I would be lost as I tried to stay afloat, if you pardon the pun. That, and I always had a massive pile of books around me. But, as luck would have it, when asked to buddy read this with a dear friend, I could not resist.\n\nWhile the book explores both sides of the Cold War clash, Jack Ryan does prove to be somewhat of the protagonist. An academic who has great knowledge of maritime history, he is tapped to help guide the Americans through this clash with their Soviet counterparts. Clancy develops the Ryan character well, keeping his backstory and some development constant throughout the novel. I was intrigued about how he would fit into the larger narrative and saw that Clancy did not want him to steal the show, using many characters to push the story along.\n\nThe large number of characters and settings used in this novel help to make it even better. This is a story told through the eyes of many men, from two countries, pushing clashing ideological beliefs. All this drips from each page, as the reader is immersed in the politic from the very beginning. The battles are numerous, if only on paper, and Clancy heightens them with strong characters throughout the story. Ramius is but one whose struggles come to light throughout the book.\n\nMany of the reviews and comments that I have read regarding this book point to its technical nature. While I agree that Clancy does get  into the dirt  when it comes to marine technology and life on a submarine, it is essential to capture the true essence of the story and struggles. This detailed narrative is not for the impatient (of whom I see there are many who choose only to make one-liner comments as reviews) or those wanting something quick. Like a submarine, this is a slow a deliberate trolling through the narrative to build up a sense of urgency. It is, perhaps, the duelling perspectives that really capture the greatness of this book. Clancy offers accounts on both sides, providing the reader with something in-depth to really see how both sides struggle throughout. The characters were on point and I found myself intrigued by how they saw things developing. Clancy uses detailed chapters to really get to the heart of the matter, which might explain why some have found it overly long winded. However, that is, to me, an essential part of the process, particularly if it is not to be a one-sided affair. I am intrigued to see how Jack Ryan fits into the larger narrative and what will come of him. While I cannot commit to binge-reading the entire series, I will be back to see how Jack Ryan develops as a character and what else Clancy has to offer.\n\nKudos, Mr. Clancy, for opening my eyes with this stellar piece of fiction. I cannot wait to explore a little more, when time permits. A perfect buddy read for someone who knows so little and will be able to question a new recruit to the US Navy!\n\nLove/hate the review?

One of them asks how long the program is - number of lines, or punched cards, or whatever.

            "content": "Writer s style is not engaging or entertaining for me. He s probably good for military technical buffs.\n\nThis guy is a popular best selling author. But not for me. I assume his fans are those who love to think and talk about military technical stuff - with a story to go along with it. The author is regularly welcomed aboard jets, submarines, and destroyers. Admirals and generals give him access, Pentagon officials debrief him, and many of his books are required reading at military colleges. So I assume he is accurate about these things.\n\nMY PROBLEMS:\nThere were too many characters to keep track of. And for each character, I only knew them through their work. There was no emotional development of characters, no seeing their feelings. I felt like this was  bring your daughter to work day,  and I was going along with my dad (and many other dads) listening and watching as they did their work and attended meetings. I wasn t excited about anything. Parts were boring. I listened to the sonar guy for a while, then I listened to the captain of a ship for a while, then I listened to the Russian leaders meet and talk about what to do, then I listened to the CIA meet and talk about what to do, then a guy calls another guy talking about what to do. Throughout the book the reader is jumping around among different groups of military and political people.\n\nI want interesting characters to watch, characters that pull me in emotionally. I want witty, interesting, or enlightening dialogue. I want interesting events that move the plot along. There were two interesting major climactic resolutions, but it took way too long to get to them, with nothing else good along the way. It was just watch the guys work. My mind wandered too often, and I wished it would be over.\n\nI saw the movie many years ago and loved it. The movie had a very different feel, and it ended sooner than the book. I think the movie was one of those  inspired by  movies rather than  based on  the book. In the BOOK Jack and other U.S. leaders all believe Marco (the captain of the RO) wants to defect, and they have a plan and prepare for it. In the MOVIE, Jack believes Marco wants to defect but another US commander doesn t. The commander plans to blow up the RO, and Jack has to convince him not to. At one point Jack lies to the US commander saying I know Marco so well that I know he will turn left at the next something. Jack was bluffing. But when Marco coincidentally turned left, the US commander cancels the order to attack. That scene was so intense that I still remember it all these years later. Nothing like that was in the book.\n\nAnyway I wanted to try Tom Clancy, which is why I read this, but I won t be reading any more.\n\nSTORY BRIEF:\nThe book is set around 1983, during the days of the  Cold War  between the U.S. and the USSR. It illustrates some of the thinking back then with nuclear threats on both sides. This is one of many books in the Jack Ryan series. Jack is an analyst for the CIA. The Red October is the name of a Russian submarine. The captain of the RO does not follow orders and is on the run from other USSR subs and ships. Jack is the first one to suggest the captain might want to defect. The U.S. navy and the Russian fleet are all trying to find the RO.\n\nNARRATOR:\nThe narrator J. Charles spoke too quickly. It was jarring to concentrate on his speed of talking. Even between scenes and chapters there were almost no pauses.\n\nDATA:\nUnabridged audiobook reading time: 16 hrs and 47 mins. Swearing language: strong, including religious swear words. Sexual content: none. Setting: Around 1983 U.S., USSR (Russia), and the Atlantic Ocean. Book copyright: 1984. Genre: military historical fiction. Ending: happy for the good guys.\nShow more",

    "description": "Librarian's Note: An alternate cover edition can be found here\n\nIn April, 1992, a young man from a well-to-do family hitchhiked to Alaska and walked alone into the wilderness north of Mt. McKinley. His name was Christopher Johnson McCandless. He had given $25,000 in savings to charity, abandoned his car and most of his possessions, burned all the cash in his wallet, and invented a new life for himself. Four months later, a party of moose hunters found his decomposed body. How McCandless came to die is the unforgettable story of Into the Wild.\n\nImmediately after graduating from college in 1991, McCandless had roamed through the West and Southwest on a vision quest like those made by his heroes Jack London and John Muir. In the Mojave Desert he abandoned his car, stripped it of its license plates, and burned all of his cash. He would give himself a new name, Alexander Supertramp, and, unencumbered by money and belongings, he would be free to wallow in the raw, unfiltered experiences that nature presented. Craving a blank spot on the map, McCandless simply threw away the maps. Leaving behind his desperate parents and sister, he vanished into the wild.",

            "content": "This book is a wonderful cautionary tale. I will probably read it again with my daughter when she is old enough to discuss it. Unfortunately, I'm afraid the reason most people will read the book and see the new upcoming movie, is for a different reason. Chris McCandless (in the book, and from what I understand in the movie), is a hero and courageous for flying in the face of everything he grew up with to find a better way. A young man unhappy with the materialism, hunger, and waste in the world; angry with his father for not being a perfect father to him; intellectually superior, a fantastic athlete in top condition... and yet a young man who died because of his own decisions and his own actions. He cut off ties to his family, hitchhiked and worked his way to Alaska, headed \"into the wild\" in April 1992, and was found dead in August 1992 most probably from starvation. How wonderful to \"fight against the odds\" and \"ask real questions\". Unfortunately, Chris didn't really fight against any odds, he took the easy way out by cutting off real relationships. Chris may have asked real questions, but he denied real people the opportunity to answer them in any way, because he had already decided what was \"the right way\". This is not heroic. It is immaturity. It is tragic and sad, yes, but not heroic or courageous.\n\nAfter reading the book, I think Chris died because he was foolish. Intellectually bright, yes. Athletically gifted, yes. But he had no wisdom. Wisdom has been defined as \"skill in living\", and wisdom is not always bestowed on the young and the healthy and the intellectually smart. The opposite of wisdom is foolishness. His anger and questioning drove him not to wisdom, but to self-reliance and an overweening arrogance in his own ability to \"get through it\". Well, we see the result of those decisions and those attitudes.... to quote Darwin, Chris is an example of how \"survival of the fittest\" applies. Chris was not \"fit\", therefore he did not \"survive\". But why wasn't he fit? He was smart and young and gifted in many ways, but he chose to abandon relationships and abandon those who loved him and create himself anew with no relationships and no ties. He walked away from people who loved him, made friends with people who came to love him, and walked away from all of that to find his answers \"in the wild\" on his own. The way away from love and relationship leads not to life, but indeed to death. And death is what Chris got.\n\nThe book quotes Chris' mother as saying, \"I haven't prayed since we lost him.\" (pg. 202) An older man who befriended Chris, Ronald Franz, also says, \"When Alex left for Alaska, I prayed. I asked God to keep his finger on the shoulder of that one; I told him that boy was special. But he let Alex die. So on December 26, when I learned what had happened, I renounced the Lord. I withdrew my church membership and became an atheist. I decided I couldn't believe in a God who would let something that terrible happen to a boy like Alex.\" (pg. 60) But God didn't do anything to Chris, except let him do as he wanted? If Chris sought real answers to his hard questions, God is there, and God can help, but you have to know you need help and submit to someone wiser than you. Chris McCandless never submitted willingly to anyone, and he certainly never admitted anyone else had teaching or wisdom for him. He was smarter than everyone else, better able to see the truth than anyone else. So the heritage Chris McCandless left is one that drives his mother to stop praying, and converts an old man to atheism. Is this the heritage anyone would want?\n\nSo read this book, but read it with questions in mind. Why are we lauding a young man as a hero who was actually a foolish man? What kind of society are we in where real courage and real heroism are somehow playing 2nd fiddle to selfishness and arrogance? When are you so intellectually intelligent that you become stupid? Is there any time when foolish decisions could be called \"courageous\"? In a search for truth and what really matters in life, is it acceptable to think nothing of hurting those people who are most vulnerable to you? When you die, will the way you lived your life cause others to abandon their faith or grow in their faith? Is it ever courageous to be selfish and think only of yourself? Is it harder to walk away from a relationship, or to stay in a relationship and work on making it better? Would you ever teach anyone else that the way to have real relationships is to limit yourself only to those people who cannot ever hurt you?\n\nReal courage, real heroism comes when you love others and you serve others. Real courage has nothing selfish in it. Fathers and husbands who remain with their families and provide for them, even though they would rather have a mid-life crisis and leave it all, they are courageous and heroic. They remain, they work, they don't father or husband perfectly, but they remain in difficult relationships. It courageous to stay in the hard parts of life, and try. Mothers and wives who sacrifice and serve again and again and again without books being written about them, without thanks, but who continue to love and give of themselves to others. That is courageous. It is hard to stay in messy relationships. It is easy to leave. It is courageous to stay and do hard things. It is easy to leave and do what you want.\n\nSo, let's read this book, but read it as a cautionary tale. This is what happens when you seemingly 'have it all', but have not love. When you die, will people be driven to become atheists? Will people stop praying when you are dead? Or will you live a life of wisdom and love? Will you leave behind you a heritage of godly love and service? Will people pray more because of the example you left them? Will they be more loving, better mothers or fathers or sisters or brothers? Or will they become angry and arrogant and foolishness? Yes, this is a good book to read. But let's read it for the right reasons and with the right questions.\n\n[NOTE: In the book, and in the movie, the author proposes that Chris ate some poison berries which caused his death. But tests have been made around the area, and plants that would have been available to Chris were tested, and no toxic berries or plants have been found. The truth is probably that he starved. Too few calories coming in, high expenditure of calories for hunting and keeping warm resulted eventually in such a calorie deficit that he died.]\n\nSome good articles I found on Chris McCandless include:\n\n\n\n\nAlaskan Park Ranger Peter Christian wrote:  I am exposed continually to what I will call the  McCandless Phenomenon.  People, nearly always young men, come to Alaska to challenge themselves against an unforgiving wilderness landscape where convenience of access and possibility of rescue are practically nonexistent [ :] When you consider McCandless from my perspective, you quickly see that what he did wasn t even particularly daring, just stupid, tragic, and inconsiderate. First off, he spent very little time learning how to actually live in the wild. He arrived at the Stampede Trail without even a map of the area. If he [had:] had a good map he could have walked out of his predicament [ :] Essentially, Chris McCandless committed suicide. [18:] Some may argue that this is what he wanted all along, given his troubled past\n\n\n****************\nAn update as of Sept 2013 as to how McCandless died. See which documents the poison contained in wild potato seeds. Consuming these seeds introduces a neurotoxin into the body which results in lathyrism. This condition causes gradual paralysis which ultimately made McCandless very weak, unable to stand or walk, and thus unable to forage or hunt for food.\nShow more",

            "content": "\"I now walk into the wild.\"\n- Christopher McCandless (1968-1992)\n\nI live a life, I suspect, that is much like yours. Wake up, go to work, come home, eat dinner, go to bed. At the end of this weekly desert, there might be a drink or ten to celebrate the victory over another five days of soul-crushing drudgery.\n\nI am a desk jockey. A paper pusher. I mean that literally; I sit in my office, and when people peer inside, they will see me moving a sheet of paper from one side to the other. It looks, to the untrained eye, like valuable labor.\n\nWhen I get the chance, though, I head to the mountains, to the wild. I love the away-ness of these trips. At the risk of sounding absurdly curmudgeonly, I like getting away from the crush of humanity (and I'm sure the crush of humanity appreciates my temporary absence).\n\nThere was at time when my friends and I would head out west every summer. We picked a destination (isolated, challenging), packed the car, and plunged into the wilderness. We undertook silly risks, because we were younger and we laughed at consequences, or at the possibility that there were consequences. Once, a little later on, we gathered around a campfire, four of us, and swore - like characters from a young adult novel - that we'd always do this: that we'd always head out to the mountains together.\n\nThen we got older. My friends married, they started having kids, and the mountains became a memory, a slideshow of pictures that showed up on the screen savers of our computers. Friends with whom I'd jumped off cliffs, slid down glaciers, and climbed rocks matured overnight into sober professionals, husbands, and fathers. It was remarkable how age engendered caution, and squelched the desire for adventure.\n\nThat was my mindset when I picked up .\n\nJon Krakauer's classic is, to put it mildly, a polarizing book. Based on the people I've surveyed, I've found that you either love it or you hate it, and whether you love it or hate it will be determined by what you think about Christopher McCandless, the young man at the center of . You will be taken in by Chris's literate, philosophical, iconoclastic, boundary-pushing vagabondism. Or you will be sickened by his selfishness, his self-pity, and the way he left a shattered family in his wake.\n\nEither way, you will have a vivid response.\n\nUpon graduating from Emory University, and instead of going on to law school (which was my choice), McCandless gave away $25,000 to charity and began his life as a tramp (or hobo, as they sometimes like to be called). I was in sixth grade when McCandless walked into the Alaskan wilderness and never returned. He was 24.\n\nThe power of is directly attributable to Krakauer's empathy for his subject. Krakauer is a solid adventure writer, but he's not a prose stylist. Rather, he uses his own life experiences to connect with Chris on a very intimate, personal level. He does not attempt any faux objectivity that is often the hallmark of \"serious\" serious journalism. Instead, Krakauer admits, straight up, that he saw his younger self in Chris, with the exception that Krakauer survived his youth, while Chris did not. For instance, there is an autobiographical section in where Krakauer tells his story about climbing the Devil's Thumb. This could easily have been a self-serving digression, but Krakauer uses that experience, and the vividness of his memory, to explore the the compulsions that drove Chris McCandless to follow his unique path to his destiny.\n\nI think Chris, in his own way, was a towering figure; he was the person I would like to be, if I had more guts and less excuses. He was a smart kid, a college grad, who came from money. His parents were messed up, but really, whose parents aren't? After college, instead of going to law school (don't go to law school, by the way), he gave away $25,000, burned his credit cards, and set out to see the west.\n\nWhatever else you call him, you can't call him a poser. Like everyone, he had his share of dreams and demons, and he set out to follow his dreams and fight his demons. There's something to be said for what he put his parent through. Still, the world forces us to be our own person. He went forward the best way he knew how, defining himself along the way. The tragedy, of course, is that the lessons he learned - about the value of friends and family - he learned too late.\n\nI don't really need to defend Chris. Krakauer does that. He is unabashedly in his corner, defending his choices, his skills, his desire to go alone to the far places, like John Muir before him. Chris McCandless was himself, fully and completely, which is saying a lot, in this day and age. Or any day and age. He was part adventurer, part philosopher, and part monk (the monk part fascinates Krakauer, who spends a lot of time wondering whether Chris died a virgin).\n\nI suppose a brief note on the movie, directed by Sean Penn, is in order. While I found it poetic and inspiring, the movie focuses too much on Chris's effect on the various people he meets on his journeys. In a way, Chris becomes some kind of wandering apostle, healing and helping those he meets along his path, before he dies a martyr's death in Alaska, a vision from a Don Maclean song (\"the world was never meant for one as beautiful as you...\"). The book, on the other hand, keeps Chris firmly grounded as a human being. Krakauer admires Chris, to be sure, but he does not neglect the warts. (However, Krakauer sharply dismisses those armchair psychiatrists who want to diagnose Chris with a mental disorder. I'm glad he does. I think it's saying soemething about the conformity of our society that anyone who bucks the trend (he gave up law school!?) is called mad).\n\nIn the end, Chris was one of those rare people who wanted to know the world intimately, and in the process of discovering those secrets, was killed by that same world. Maybe there was something quixotic or foolish in his quest; maybe he should have taken a job, taken a wife, found a safe desk behind which to grow old. Or maybe there is something foolish in us, to believe that we can outlive the world with our caution.\nShow more",

            "content": "Overall, I was pretty disappointed with this book. The genesis of the book was an in-depth magazine article, and I suspect that the article was superb. But I just don't think there's enough here to warrant an entire book. As evidence, I point to several lengthy chapters that have nothing to do with the underlying story--they discuss other people who have gone \"into the wild\" and, surprisingly, Krakauer includes a whole chapter about himself.\n\nMy other problem is that I found myself unable to identify or empathize with the central character here. I think that Chris McCandless was not much more than a privileged, entitled, selfish, and undeniably intelligent person who threw everything away and nearly destroyed his family for reasons that weren't any clearer by the end of the book than they were at the beginning. I worried far more about his parents and his sister, who he called his \"best friend,\" than I did about him.\n\nI ended up \"finishing\" the book by skimming the last 1/3, or maybe even the last 1/2. I almost gave this only 1 star but decided to go with 2 because I want to give Krakauer the benefit of the doubt--it's a well-written book, I just don't think it needed to be written at all.\nShow more",

            "content": "In 1992, roughly around the same time Chris McCandless was living out his final days in the Alaskan wilderness, I would have been enjoying the summer holidays before embarking on my final year at school, contemplating the big wide world and what I was going to do with the rest of my life. It wasn't until watching Sean Penn's film in 2008 I would learn of Chris's story, a story that moved me, immensely.\n\nI always presumed Jon Krakauer's book would be some huge epic, but was surprised on finding out it's a little over 200 pages. I simply had to read it, just don't know why it took me so long.\n\n\nIt's going to be difficult to review this without making my own thoughts on Chris known first. Although it isn't as straightforward as this, taking everything into consideration, if there is to be a camp criticism and a camp McCandless, then I firmly sit with McCandless. He was an awe-inspiring bright young man, who simply broke free from the establishment to follow his own path, a path, going by both book and film that was simply stunning. I know there are people that criticized his adventure as reckless, stupid, dangerous and well unequipped for the treacherous landscape of wild Alaska, and were even angry with him, that he deserved what was coming to him, disrespecting nature. Let's not forget something, he probably died a slow agonizing death that you wouldn't wish on anybody, why the anger from people who didn't even know him? it was nobody else's business what Chris chose to undertake. As the old saying goes, it's a free country. And he was just that, free.\n\nI do feel for his family of course, I can't begin to imagine the pain and anguish they would have had to injure, and the fact he didn't try to contact his sister Karine, who he was dearly close to, was strange. I just hope his family came to eventually realize that the two years Chris spent on the road he would have been immensely happy. That's got to count for something. Had he gone on to work, no doubt well paid work, you get the impression he just wouldn't want to be there. Had Chris been some wacko or mentally incapacitated person I would have taken far more pity over his story, but he wasn't, he was highly intelligent and knew exactly what he was doing. That's why, although he came to a sad end, I am still on the whole, happy for the guy.\n\nThe strongest parts of the book for me are actually not the last months in Alaska (which had to be recreated based on Chris  diary and the evidence found at the site of his death), but the memories of people whom Chris had met on his travels, with whom he had caught rides, worked and stayed, struck up friendships. I was especially moved by the generosity of strangers and by Chris s run in with 81 year old Ron Franz, whom he managed to convince to give up the monotonous life and take up adventure. These two years of traveling had no boundaries, no obligations, no limitations, no expectations. Just exploring the land, exploring life, and himself.\n\nJon Krakauer also included memories from his own youth, trying to draw comparisons with Chris, along with some other historical journey's similar to what McCandless embarked on.\nChris was a keen reader, and used literature as a way to inspire him on the road, there were quotes from the likes of Leo Tolstoy, Jack London, Henry David Thoreau and Wallace Stegner that he noted down in his diary, these play an important role for any outsider trying to understand just who Chris was.\n\nThe book works wonders on different levels, it deals with non fiction in a dramatic storytelling way, like an adventure novel, but also stays as close as possible to the facts and truths recovered from Chris's diary. I didn't think his epic story could be condensed down to 200 pages, but it works, only concentrating on the things that truly matter. I was moved to the core.

            "content": "Chris McCandless didn't want to prove anything to anyone; he just wanted to be free and live as he saw fit. So far, from the image of the bohemian and thoughtless teenager, Jon Krakauer portrays him to us as an intelligent and obstinate young man with remarkable capacities to unite around him. He leaves those who have met him during his travels this feeling of great sociability, which contrasts significantly with the need for solitude that he regularly showed, a little the desire to owe nothing to anyone and find the solutions to his problems.\nWhen he leaves his family at a young age after high school, he goes from odd jobs to odd jobs, squats where the wind carries him, and fate brings him down. He must have had a lucky star because his meetings always seem benevolent, and this is perhaps one of the elements that will encourage him to push his adventures even further. His thirst for self-sufficiency will guide him to Alaska in a desert, where he will spend several months with the fatal outcome we know.\nThe author breaks stereotypes and does a real investigation work by understanding this young man's personality, who wishes to break with modern life. Far from judgment and bias, he analyzes the situation by comparing it to other life paths similar to Chris McCandless. It also seems that his death is still a little enigmatic because many news sites on the subject are always looking for genuine reasons.\nThat's a genuine interest in this book, which brings us back tirelessly to the harsh reality of life outside civilization.\nShow more",

            "content": "I love Jon Krakauer. I didn't find one single thing about the Alex McCandless even remotely interesting. He came across as a spoiled brat with no concept of reality - basically because of his priveleged upbringing. But somehow, he blamed his parents for that void of myopic self absorption.\n\nI live in Alaska and I've lived in Idaho and Colorado and Oregon . . . basically AROUND people who love the great outdoors. I am more comfortable in a heated coffee shop READING about the great outdoors. Still, I know that heading into any forest - particularly one at that latitude and altitude in pursuit of adventure with (a) no food, (b) no gear, (c) no plan and (d) no backup plan is nothing short of delusional or maybe just stupid.\n\nI absolutely adore Jon Krakauer's attempts to explain Alex's possible motives and angst. I get that Krakauer identifies with some of what gnawed at Alex . . . that discontent . . . that feeling that life can't possibly be this pointless . . . etc. I wonder about those things with fairly consistent frequency. I suppose I have my own means of stamping those feelings out (alternating burst of extreme carbohydrate consumption and running or spinning; work and volunteerism). Still, the fact that Alex died of exposure in an abandoned bus in Denali National Park is less poignant than poetic - justice, that is. Darwinism, if you want to be cruel.\n\n(Cringe) That sounded really awful, didn't it? But Krakauer carefully paints a picture of a young man completely disillusioned with the life that his parents provided for him, the future they groomed him for. A life easier, better than theirs. He points to his parents' mistakes and flaws as lightening rods for Alex's rejection of them and his pursuit of deeper understanding.\n\nWhat a luxury. One that we all pursue at some point in our lives and if we have any sense, grow out of. I was constantly irritated with Alex for hitching, homelessness, biting every hand that tried to feed him. His lonely, desperate death not at all surprising and not terribly sad, either . . . except for what it put his family through.\n\nI had no interest in seeing the movie. I saw trailer images of a young man looking off into the wildnerness with depth and intensity and that is NOT the Alex McCandless I got to know in the book. If Sean Penn managed to paint a more enlightened image of Alex, then he deviated from the book quite a bit.\nShow more",

In \"A Temporary Matter,\" published in The New Yorker, a young Indian-American couple faces the heartbreak of a stillborn birth while their Boston neighborhood copes with a nightly blackout. In the title story, an interpreter guides an American family through the India of their ancestors and hears an astonishing confession. Lahiri writes with deft cultural insight reminiscent of Anita Desai and a nuanced depth that recalls Mavis Gallant.",

            "content": "How s this for blurbs: when the female author published this collection of short stories at age 32 in 1999, she won the Pulitzer Prize, the Pen/Hemingway Award and the New Yorker s Debut Book of the Year.\n\nLike the author s other collection of shorts that I have reviewed (Unaccustomed Earth, 2008) these stories are about Bengali immigrants in the US from the Bengal area of India, around Kolkata (formerly Calcutta). There are about 250 million Bengalis in the subcontinent, about 2/3 making up the Muslim nation of Bangladesh and about 1/3, mostly Hindus, in West Bengal, a state in India.\n\n\n\nBut, with the exception of two stories, these folks are not urban slum dogs --they are upper-income folks with PhD s and MD s who grew up speaking English in India and who came to the USA to be doctors, professors and engineers in the high-tech beltway bandit firms around Boston. They live in Boston townhouses and upscale suburbs. And there s a twist to saying these stories are about  immigrants  because most folks in these stories were fully assimilated into the global upper class before they even arrived in the USA.\n\nHere s a sample of what the nine stories are about:\n\nIn the title story, a man who is an interpreter of native Indian languages for a doctor is also a tour guide for visitors to India. He tells this to a Bengali couple, with their kids, visiting from the states. The wife, desperate for someone to confide in, thinks he is like a psychological counselor and pours out her secrets, shocking the tour guide.\n\nIn  Mrs. Sen s,  an eleven-year old boy learns the depth of the loneliness of a Bengali woman in Boston who desperately misses her native country and her large extended family back in India.\n\n A Real Durwan  is one of two stories set back in India, not in the USA. A poverty-stricken old woman, bent with age, has a job sweeping the stairwell in an apartment building. She sleeps on a pile of rags below the mailboxes. As improvements are made to the building the tenants decide they want a real concierge and toss her onto the street.\n\nIn  Sexy,  a young woman listens every day to her co-worker aghast at the infidelity of her cousin s husband who has left his wife for a younger unmarried woman. Although she and the co-worker are best of friends, the woman can t tell her that she herself is having an affair with a married Bengali man.\n\nIn  This Blessed House,  a young Bengali couple has just moved into a new home and they keep finding posters of Jesus behind closet doors, crosses, statues of Mary in the bushes and nativity scenes in nooks and corner. Over her husband s objections, the wife collects these and displays them on the mantle.    We re not Christian,  Sanjeev said. Lately he had begun noticing the need to state the obvious to Twinkle.  Sanjeev is an introverted engineer. And it could just be that life-of-the-party Twinkle, despite her poor housekeeping skills, could just be the complementary partner Sanjeev needs if he has sense to hold on to her.\n\nThe stories in the author s collection, Unaccustomed Earth, were very good but Maladies is excellent. No wonder it won so many awards.\n\nMap from portcities.org.uk\nShow more",

In exchange for her services, the residents allow Boori Ma to sleep in front of the collapsible gates leading into the tenement.\n\n Sexy  centers on Miranda, a young white woman who has an affair with a married Indian man named Dev. Although one of Miranda's work friends is an Indian woman named Laxmi, Miranda knows very little about India and its culture.\n\nIn this story, 11-year-old Eliot begins staying with Mrs. Sen a university professor's wife after school.

            "content": "In 2000 Jhumpa Lahiri became the first Indian American to win the Pulitzer Prize for fiction for her short story collection The Interpreter of Maladies. In these nine poignant stories, Lahiri relates the Indian immigrant experience, connecting the tales and creating one voice for them. The stories shared a sadness of being separated from one's family by thousands of miles, yet also offered a glimmer of hope for their lives in India or the United States.\n\nNot generally a reader of short stories, this year I read two powerful novels, Homegoing and The Book of Unknown Americans, which told one story in vignettes. Unlike these two books, however, Maladies is nine separate stories which share one overarching theme. The characters never meet even if they came from the same city in India to the same city in America, craving the company and friendship of other Indian Americans. Lahiri does a masterful job of giving purpose to her protagonists even if in some cases we only get to know them for fifteen short pages. As each story begins in a negative light and ends positively, the reader looks forward to each successive story in the collection.\n\nEven though each story is brilliant in its own right, three stand out in creating an upbeat environment upon conclusion: the keynote story The Interpreter of Maladies where Mrs. Das comes to terms with herself as the story ends; The Story of Bibi Haldar where the title character is ostracized and desires to marry above all else; and the ending story The Third and Final Continent with an unnamed protagonist who looks back on his first days in America thirty years later. All share the theme of Indians who find it easier to hang on their customs than assimilate, creating people proud of their culture yet longing for their old country. This did not seem all too different to me than immigrants from other ethnicities and Lahiri does a superb job of making the Indian experience stand alone.\n\nLahiri was raised in suburban Boston in Rhode Island and appears to create her characters from childhood memories. Whether it was two Indian girls going trick or treating or a newlywed couple grappling with whether to observe Hinduism or Christianity, the stories are written in a labor of love. Each story is penned with the details of the color and texture of the women's saris to the brand of tea that the characters drank. From reading the stories of of these immigrants, I felt empathy with their lives as second half twentieth century arrivals to America.\n\nJhumpa Lahiri has weaved together stories of sadness yet has her readers leave feeling positive about her characters. Although short in length, each story is powerful from start to finish and has the readers desiring to know more about the characters' lives. A collection worthy of the Pulitzer, I look forward to reading more of Lahiri's work. Interpreter of Maladies rates 5 bright stars.\nShow more",

            "content": "Writing short stories is not easy. A novel is an easier literary form in a way - it allows you the space for character and plot development and gives you the space to slowly fall in love with it.\n\nShort story, on the other hand, is like literary speed dating; it only has so much time to set itself apart and make a somewhat decent expression. It's much easier for me to think of good novelists than good short story writers. Let's try - Hemingway, Poe, Bradbury, Chekhov, maybe a few more. Well, I guess Jhumpa Lahiri can join the exclusive club. Her novel left me wanting more, but her short stories are very well-done. Apparently the Pulitzer people thought the same thing.\n\nIf I were to describe the stories in in a single word, it'd be . They are permeated by . The stories are slow to unfold, contemplative, intensely lyrical, nostalgic, and quietly moving.\nLahiri writes about India and Indian heritage, be it Indian immigrants to American university towns or people in India. The country itself, its culture, its beliefs, its traditions, and the pain of missing it are ever-present in her fiction. dealt with exactly the same premise, and the similarities between that novel and these stories are profound. The similar theme, repeating over and over in the stories, makes you anticipate the storylines, but somehow it does not detract from enjoyment of the prose and the stories. ; Lahiri's storytelling hinges on the inner world of her characters, their hopes, dreams, and memories.\nOverall, I enjoyed this story collection quite a bit. I chose to ration it over a few days rather than swallow them all at once, and it was a good experience. . Now I'd be curious to see if and how Lahiri can expand her themes and touch on the subjects other than immigrant experience.\nShow more",

            "content": "I usually don't enjoy short stories that much. Collections of short stories tend to have stories that are really strong mixed together with ones that aren't and this was no exception. I do think the foreward for the kindle edition that I had contributed a lot to my enjoyment of the stories. It really helped frame a connecting thread through out each story and tied it back to the title of the collection. I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed the stories as much without having the foreward highlight the themes to look for or without it explaining what made the collection great. I find that often that is the case, like i definitely wouldn't have understood the significance and enjoyment of Don Quixote without the foreward. I do find short stories a lot less satisfying than novels though, they lack a certain build up and depth usually that I would get with a novel, and I tend to find the endings to them to feel much less strong. I don't think the last story, The Third and Final Continent, was that great and definetly felt like one of the weakest. I did like The Treatment of Bibi Haldar, This Blessed House, Mrs. Sen's, Interpreter of Maladies, and When Mr.Pirzada Came to Diner to name a few. I might be forgetting some. Anyway the book definitely did a good job exploring themes of cultural differences, living in diaspora, and a general malaise of life. A 4.5 stars for this one.\n\nShow more",

            "content": " Interpreter of maladies  evokes that space in limbo, that straddling identity of immigrants trying to start a new life abroad and the cultural displacement they suffer both in their native and adopted countries. Enriched with colorful details of the Indian tradition, cuisine and celebrations, this collection of nine stories addresses the universal struggle of getting adapted to the ways of a foreign homeland without losing one s original roots.\n\nLahiri s prose is fluid and simple, but it more than meets the challenge of building a bridge between two different worlds with amazing precision, delineating a tight-knitted atmosphere that serves as common ground for all the stories. Men and women who strive for balance in arranged marriages, resisting the strain of prolonged homesickness, isolation and guilt; feelings deeply rooted in the complex web of human relationships that alter the way time, place and expectations are perceived.\nThe characters that populate Lahiri s world live in the tense duality of being exiles, but proud to have left India to build a prosperous life in the West. Their Indian heritage acts as a catalyzer for all the events that seem to unfold in slow motion like a sequence of images that uphold the solitary confinement of the characters, leading up to an anticlimactic outcome that is muffled by the mundane quality of the troubles that haunt them.\n\nThe succinct, restrained expression of Lahiri s storytelling is gradually accumulated and acquires the poetic force of what has been hinted at but not completely articulated into words; a full world of possibilities that amounts to a summation of silent questions that don t aspire to be answered.\nThe future is put on hold in that familiar sensation of not knowing what is going to cross our paths next, maybe an opportunity, maybe a reversal, maybe a caressing whisper that assures us that everything is going to be alright. Or maybe all at once, making a perfect conjunction of imperfect circumstances, just like it happens more often than not in everyday life.\nMaybe that s the reason why Lahiri s stories sound so intimate and real; because they tell our life stories with all their mundane struggles without dismissing the beauty of their ordinariness.\nShow more",

    "description": "In April 1942, Lale Sokolov, a Slovakian Jew, is forcibly transported to the concentration camps at Auschwitz-Birkenau. When his captors discover that he speaks several languages, he is put to work as a T towierer (the German word for tattooist), tasked with permanently marking his fellow prisoners.\n\nImprisoned for more than two and a half years, Lale witnesses horrific atrocities and barbarism but also incredible acts of bravery and compassion. Risking his own life, he uses his privileged position to exchange jewels and money from murdered Jews for food to keep his fellow prisoners alive.\n\nOne day in July 1942, Lale, prisoner 32407, comforts a trembling young woman waiting in line to have the number 34902 tattooed onto her arm. Her name is Gita, and in that first encounter, Lale vows to somehow survive the camp and marry her.\n\nA vivid, harrowing, and ultimately hopeful re-creation of Lale Sokolov's experiences as the man who tattooed the arms of thousands of prisoners with what would become one of the most potent symbols of the Holocaust, is also a testament to the endurance of love and humanity under the darkest possible conditions.",

The day I met Lale Sokolov changed my life, as our friendship grew and he embarked on a journey of self scrutiny, entrusting the inner most details of his life during the Holocaust.

To some I have shared that my family's \"MA\" was in Auschwitz (everyone called her MA - her daughters, her grandchildren, her great grandchildren, her friends, etc.). She used to say \"I have lost everything that can ever be lost  and \"I have given everything can that ever be given\". She passed away in 2017 at the age of 95. We just had her headstone unveiling. This was probably not the best book for me to read at this time - but then again maybe it was...In the last years of her life, I would go with her to the German Consulate to prove she was still alive, so she could continue receiving her reparation checks. She would get dressed in her best outfit and walk in proudly to announce she was still alive. There used to be a long line of survivors waiting to go in, the last time I went with her, we were the only ones in the waiting room. I used to dread going there with her. It was a production. Days before she would get her hair washed and set, the day of she would get up early and do her makeup and fuss over her outfit. I would always say \"why do you dress up to go there?\" She would always say \"I am proud of who I am.\" and tell me not to embarrass her by wearing my \"schmata\" and would it kill me to put on a little red lipstick. Then she would announce to everyone in the room that I was her granddaughter. Now I will never go again. Last year we had our first Thanksgiving, Hanukkah and Christmas without her (I have a half Jewish - half Christian family). There are not many survivors left in the world which is why I am glad that books like this exist.\n\n\"To Save one is to save the world.\"\n\nThis book is based on a true story. I always love books based on true stories. In many ways, I think they are the best kind. I also love the pictures of Lale and Gita Sokolov. Lale told his story over the course of three years to the Author. Lale became the Tatowierer \"Tattooist\" of Auschwitz and Birkenau. Being the tattooist gives him special perks - more rations, better sleeping conditions, ability to move around the camp more freely. He also was able to exchange the money and prized possessions of those who died in the gas chambers for food and medicine. He was generous and provided for many. He saved lives and I wonder how many survived due to him acquiring medicine and extra food for them.\n\nWhile giving a tattoo, he meets Gita and feels an instant attraction to her. This book is not only a book about survival during the bleakest of times, it is about triumph of the human spirit, about being pushed to the breaking point but never breaking, about love, about compassion for others, about hope, about losing your faith and about never losing your faith. It also shows brutality, hatred, and evil but what I hope people take away is the compassion, strength, dignity and resilience that Lale and so many others named in this book showed. This book is about a lot of things but mainly one man's inner strength which allowed him to go on, to never give up, to have compassion for others, who risked his life many times to help others. During the darkest times, there will always be those who shine and Lale Sokolov was one of those.\n\nLike many survivors, Lale and Gita moved around until they found their place in Australia, began a family and lead a happy and successful life. Lale proved to have \"nine lives\" and I was happy to see that he was able to prosper and be reconnected with Gita after the war.\n\nI thought this book was well written and I was sucked me into Lale's world. Although there are scenes of violence and murder/killings, they are not incredibly graphic. With any book dealing with the Holocaust, you know it is going to be sad and scenes are going pull at your heartstrings. This one will as well. I think most will really enjoy this book and hopefully learn a few things. For instance, I always thought the tattoos were put on using crude tattoo machines/guns similar to the one used when I got a tattoo. I was wrong. My family member never talked about it. I wonder did Lale give Ma her tattoo? Who knows.?\n\nI think reading the Author's note at the end of the book is beneficial. Again, there are pictures of Lale and Gita there. It was nice to put faces with the names. When reading books such as this, I think most readers will wonder, could they have survived. I believe most of us will never know what we are capable of until we are placed to the test. God willing, none of us are ever placed to this test.\n\n4.5 stars\n\nI received a copy of this book from Bonner Publishing Australia and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.\n\nSee more of my reviews at\nShow more",

            "content": "Considering \"The Tattooist of Auschwitz\" is a harrowing true story, it was truly compelling and utterly unputdownable. It's without a doubt one of only a few books that will stay with me a very long time, it's that unforgettable and one that keeps you thinking about the story well after you've put it down.\nLale Sokolov is a well dressed, charming ladies' man - however he is also a Jew. On arrival at Auschwitz in 1942 he immediately stands out to his fellow prisoners who save his life when he takes ill. In the camp he is put to work in the privileged position of the 'Tatowierer' - the tattooist - to mark his fellow prisoners as they arrive in camp. One of them is a girl called Gita who captures his heart immediately. Given a reason to survive Lale uses his position for the greater good even through struggles and extreme suffering, with the hope of one day being with Gita forever, outside of the camp.\nAlthough upsetting, saddening and at times quite unimaginable, there is such a beautiful love story at the heart of the tale that you can't help smiling at. I immediately took to all the real life characters, they were excellently portrayed whether good or bad and could imagine the whole true scenario with such clarity.\nThe author Heather Morris took several years to write Lale's story in her book with the input of the main protagonist himself and even becoming a very good friend with him. She has ultimately written a story Lale would be very proud of and which tells of his and Gita's tale of wanting to be together through one of the worst and sickening periods of our history with the utmost care and consideration. Compassionately written with sensitivity, its emotive, thought provoking, awe inspiring and certainly puts your own everyday problems into perspective.\nThis book wasn't as brutal and as hard hitting as some holocaust books I've read although equally saddening, therefore I feel this could be read by slightly younger readers without offending or upsetting.\nI really can't recommend this stunning book highly enough, it a definite must read for 2018 and it gets a fantastic 5 stars for a heart wrenching unforgettable read.\nShow more",

I enjoyed what was there but there seemed to be so much left out.\n\nLale was obviously a charming rogue who managed to survive all those years in Auschwitz despite bringing himself to the attention of the authorities repeatedly and in very serious ways. It was amazing that a life long love affair could have begun in such a place, and even more amazing that they both survived and found each other again after the war. Obviously it was meant to be.\n\nThere must have been a lot more to this story than we are made aware of. I found the author's style to be simplistic which left me detached from events. I even felt occasionally that the book was aimed at a young adult audience as various atrocities were mentioned only in passing. As a reader I never felt the pain or the sorrow, just watched it from a distance. To me the author let the subject down.\n\nFortunately the story is so incredible it stands up for itself.

            "content": "Right after I started reading this book there was a story on the local news about a new exhibit at the Jewish Community Center in our area. The exhibit highlights the Holocaust survivors from this area. At kiosks you can click on a name, read a bio but what struck me the most was that you can also see a video of the survivor telling their story. The utmost importance of these stories is reflected at the beginning of this book by author Graeme Simsion: \"It reminds us that every one of the unimaginably large number of Holocaust victims was an individual with a unique story....\" . It's really not possible to know what it was like in Auschwitz or the other camps no matter how much we read about the Holocaust, but it is through the stories of the survivors that we can try to understand, even if only a little . Heather Morris has retold the story of Lale Sokolov, a Jewish prisoner at Auschwitz who becomes the camp tattooist and while there finds the love of his life, Gita. This stared out as a screenplay she wrote as Lale told her his story and has been developed into this \"novel\".\n\nLale from the first day he arrives in Auschwitz by cattle car, makes a vow to himself that he would survive this and after falling in love with Gita, he makes a promise to her that they will have a life together when they are out . That he can speak multiple languages saves Lale multiple times as well as connections made with other people imprisoned, with workers from the outside and even a German guard. With jewelry and cash gotten from the women who work in the building where belongings are sorted, Lale with his savvy, his courage and with some luck barters for time with Gita for the price of chocolate, a piece of sausage , a hunk of bread, a diamond or ruby. But he also provides as much food as he can to others. He helps many people along the way putting himself in danger each day as each day he tattoos numbers onto the arms of the new inhabitants. He does seem to have an existence in some ways better than most in the camp and better than when he first arrived until he is caught with the jewels. It is obvious that he survives, so there's no spoiler here that Lale continues to have the capacity for hope and love that seems impossible as he endures.\n\nThis is a story told with love about courage in the face of the horrors of the camps and loss of family, courage sustained by the strength of the human spirit and it's a love story that I'll never forget. There is not much more I can say other than what Lale himself tells Morris - that he wanted his story recorded so \"It would never happen again.\"\n\nI received an advanced copy of this book from Bonnie Zaffre through NetGalley.\nShow more",

It seemed as if some piece always needed to be repaired or purchased for one occasion or another. For my tenth birthday I received a small sapphire and diamond ring which was too large and needed to be resized. One day after school off we went to see Marty and Irv. It was an unseasonably warm fall day and Irv had his shirtsleeves rolled up. When he placed his arm on the glass countertop, I saw the tattooed numbers on his arm for the very first time. I felt, also for the first time, a cold clenching my stomach. That very day, at the age of ten, I had watched Night and Fog as part of my fifth grade curriculum and my physical reaction was the painful shock of recognition. It was disturbing to me that this kind and gentle man had been subjected to and survived the death camps. I was raised to be a polite child so I didn t say anything but I do remember having a serious conversation with my mother about it on our way home.\n\nThis experience, which is still so vivid to me, is one of the many reasons I find it difficult to rate  based on true  accounts about the holocaust. What I will say about this book is that it tells a story of hope amid horror. I will also say that the writing is sophomoric. However, I do think this is a book that is well suited for young teens as an introduction to this very dark part of history.\nShow more",

The tragic stories of bereaved mothers, fathers, wives, husbands, and the fiendish methods of torture in these camps will beset your mind for a long time. Lale and Gita had to go through hell every day, fearing that they will die at any second if a senior officer doesn't like what they do. The empathy amid the chaos, the love amid the hatred will all keep us glued to this book. I have read more than dozen books related to the Holocaust. My heart was still filled with extreme levels of anger and sadness when I read in detail about the wagons which were used to transport people to the concentration camps, screening procedures for sorting out the prisoners, the capricious nature of the Nazi officers, the cacophony of cries from people inside gas chambers where thousands of people were killed. Will Lale and Gita survive the atrocities of the concentration camp? This book will give you the answer.\n\n\n\nThis is something we will wonder when we read this book. In the initial part of this book, we can see young Lale asking his mother to teach him about love.\n\n\nWe can see Gita saying this about Lale in the latter part of this book\n\nWe can see Lale telling this to Gita in the last part of this book\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is which helped Lale to survive until then. We can see even Nazi officers were surprised that Lale was still alive.\n\n\n\nMany people were involved in the functioning of the concentration camps. But I think Josef Mengele was the worst person among them. He was also known as\n\nIt is scary to read that he was also a Doctor whom we expect to be empathetic and kind to others. The barbaric Medical experiments he did on innocent people were the scariest thing I ever heard about. We can see victims of his actions in this novel and how they felt after seeing him again after the Medical experiments.\n\n\n\n\nIt is really touching to see Lale risking his life in one of the most terrible situations humankind has witnessed for procuring food for the concentration camp people. He was sure that he would be shot on the spot if they find him smuggling food and medicines to the inmates. When one of the prisoners asks\n\nour hearts will also melt like chocolate. She asks for the chocolates like her last wish before dying. This shows us the value of something so simple as chocolates in our lives and why we should never take anything for granted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe writing of this story could have been better as we can see some problems in the writing style commonly seen when a screenwriter becomes an author. This book has just 272 pages which can be considered a little short for this book, especially when the author had an extraordinary real-life story in her hands. Despite these shortcomings, I simply loved this book.\n\n\nIf you are above 18 years and have a strong heart, and haven't read any books related to the Holocaust, this will be the perfect book to read. This book will make you more humble and understand how lucky we are compared to those innocent souls who had to go through extreme conditions in Auschwitz-Birkenau.\n\n                         \n\n| | | | | | |\nShow more",

Rather than read the print version of The Tattooist of Auschwitz, I chose to listen to the audio version, narrated by Richard Armitage, who is becoming a favorite narrator of mine. In this book, we follow twenty six year old Lale Sokolov, a Slovakian Jew, forcibly transported to the concentration camps at Auschwitz-Birkenau, in 1942. We learn of his love for a young woman who he meets in the camp, when he tattoos her arm, as he did for other prisoners entering the camps. Lale passed away in 2006 but spent the three years before he died, relating his memories of his time at Auschwitz. \n\nThe story is brutal because this is the story of the Holocaust. The horror of what happened to over a million people is behind this story of two people who survive the camps and live to marry and raise a son. Lale wasn't willing to tell his story until his wife died because he was afraid of being labeled a Nazi collaborator, due to his work as a tattooist and the privileges he received for doing such work. As with other stories about the Holocaust that I have read in the last two years, my mind can't even grasp the horror of what happened. It is through reading stories like this that I want to remember the people who lost their lives, many of them lost in a pile of bodies, never to be identified, once they were taken prisoner and having their humanity diminished by men who thought they were better. \n\nThe entire time I read books like this one, my heart goes out to each individual that suffered...in my way, I want to pay homage to the individual people whose lives were minimized and taken. I don't want to forget what happened, as hard as it is to remember. I was able to borrow this book from Hoopla, via my local library. \n\nPublished September 4, 2018\nShow more",

Perhaps it was the expectation I always harbor for a book about the Holocaust, or perhaps the book contained things that I just had a hard time believing.\n\nThis was basically a love story between two people, Lale and Gita who met while she was waiting to be tattooed by Lale and instantly fell in love. They manage to meet on many occasions and share time together and even make love. Lale, meanwhile is able to collect diamonds, money, and other jewels from people working in the sorting of prisoners' clothes which he barters for food, chocolate, and other things with a Russian workman and his son. He shares his food with those that he can which of course is a wonderful thing to have done. Eventually, when the war is close to ending, he is freed and while Gita has been sent away from Auschwitz he eventually meets up with her and they marry and have a son after immigrating to Australia.\n\nIn thinking about this novel, I believe it was the writing of the story which held it down for me. It seemed that the author made the telling so matter of fact and I could not perceive an emotional empathy that one is ever so sure any prisoner in Auschwitz would certainly have had.\n\nI know that both Lale and Gita were real people who suffered immensely in the camp and of course lost so many family and friends. My heart breaks ever time I read a book that details the atrocities that were done to the Jews, Gypsies, handicapped and others during the war.\n\nSo, I am very sad that I did not connect with this story. At the end of the book, Lale and Gita's son wrote a foreword which was quite good with the right amount of emotion and love for his parents. I think perhaps he should have taken up the task of writing his parents' story. For through his few short pages, I saw more of Lale and Gita than the author showed me with the entire book.\n\nInterestingly I just read this article...\nShow more",

This 'work' turns out to be the concentration camps on Auschwitz and Birkenau.\n\nWe witness first hand the atrocities Lale sees happen, and also the cruelty and torture he endures at the hands of the Nazi's. Despite knowing this was a 'memoir' of sorts, and that Lale would eventually escape, I was still terrified when reading this. Books like this need to be published and read, as I think that despite everyone knowing what the Holocaust was, I think people might be in danger of forgetting just how truly horrifying it was, and the lowest depths of humanity.\n\nThough not always 100% gripping, I feel that it added to storytelling. Not everyday was filled with violence, some days nothing happened at all - and the prisoners whiled away the days, too starved or beaten to really do anything. Non-fiction books aren't always designed to be enthralling, and for me this story's purpose was more for education and the sharing of someone's past, rather than to simply entertain the reader.\n\nI've seen a few reviews commenting on the writing style, how it is written quite factually rather than emotionally, and to be honest I do agree. It is written more as a timeline, than a novel. There is a lot of focus on the romance, where I would have rather had more info on the other prisoners/conditions etc. But I understand it was done this way because it is the couple's story to tell; I just would have preferred more detail in other places.\n\n\n3.5 stars\n\nShow more",

Lale is a Jew. He is on the first transport of men from Slovakia to Auschwitz in 1942. The concentration camp was very horrifying. Lale did have some special privileges, since he was the tattoist. He had lots of freedom than the other prisoners. He was so brave and had lots of courage. He would exchange jewels and money from murdered Jews for food to keep others alive. If he was caught he would of been killed. Many prisoners owed him their survival. He was a leader among the other prisoners.\n\nTheir are some graphic scenes that are a little dark. This book stands out from other Holocaust related novels. It is an emotional read. The Nazi guards are monsters, they kill and hurt human beings. Lale was determined to survive. This is a terrible story but it also is a story of hope and courage.\n\nI really did love this story. It was almost like reading a memoir, but a little different than a memoir. This story is an emotional read, but I also found it uplifting at times.\nThe Holocaust was horrific and couldn't believe all the awful things that happened in the concentration camp. I would say this is a safer read than other Holocaust novels.\nI really loved Lale's true story. I am so happy that the author spent a lot of time with him, to tell his story.\n\nShe really did an amazing job on his character. All the characters were very well done and made this novel come alive. I loved the love story between Lale and Gita and how they fall in love at first sight. I love a romance in a novel only when there is lots of suspense. Its always the suspense that I am looking for and this one has ok\nplenty of it.\n\nI felt so sad for Cilka, and everything she went through. I also felt sad for Leon. There are some scenes that are graphic but this is the Holocaust, a horrifying time and as I mentioned before this is a safer read than other Holocaust books.\n\nI could not put this book down. It was a page turner. I loved the writing style. I am really loving historical novels more and more because I think they are needed because we need to remember what happened so that history isn't forgotten.\n\nThis was a Traveling Sister read and I loved reading this with them and it was a wonderful discussion. This is a great book to do as a group read.\nI want to thank Netgalley, the publisher and Heather Morris for a copy of this book in exchange for a honest review.\nShow more",

            "content": "what a comfort it is to know that, even in the most desperate and tragically unfathomable of circumstances, love and hope are possible and can be found.\n\nthis was a truly touching story about lale and gita and how the love they found for each other in auschwitz helped them survive. the story is based on true events, information gathered from lales interviews with the author. lale waited until after the death of gita to open up about his experiences due to fear of being perceived as a nazi sympathiser. but goodness, this was a story that needed to be told.\n\nand i feel rather heartless giving a book with that sort of gravity anything less than 5 stars, but i was very let down when it came to the writing and the way the story was told. i would have much rather heard the story told from lale himself, as i dont think heather morris did his story justice. the writing was very flat and didnt evoke the sense of emotion i would have hoped for from a story as memorable as this.\n\nregardless, i am still grateful i read this, for there were so many valuable lessons within this book. lessons on what it means to be human, how far one would go to survive, how love can be found anywhere, and most importantly, the power of hope.\n\nShow more",

            "content": "The German government needed workers for their labor camps. In 1942, all families in Slovakia were ordered to provide a child eighteen or older for work detail or risk having the entire family sent to concentration camp. Lale Sokolov hoped that by going to Prague to await these instructions his family would be safe. He did not expect to be forced into a cattle wagon and be transported to Auschwitz. He was determined to do as he was told, reveal little about himself and always be observant.\n\nLale's upbeat manner as well as deference to his capo helped him secure the job of \"Tetovierer\", the tattooist. Rules: Look down. Be quick and efficiently tattoo the five numbers written on each person's piece of paper. In order to survive, he had to defile innocent people. The job of \"Tetovierer\" did have some perks. Lale was given his own room and increased food rations which he hid under his sleeve to distribute to others when possible. One day, Lale saw a girl with the darkest brown eyes. Gita. He made a vow to himself. He will leave Auschwitz a free man. He has just met the love of his life!\n\nThrough cunning, luck and love, Lale is instrumental in setting up a barter system with paid bricklayers, Victor and Yuri. Food and medicine are exchanged for gems and currency smuggled out of the \"Canada\" building where some of Gita's friends work to empty the pockets of clothing from\nnew arrivals at Auschwitz. Diamonds and chocolate entice an occasional guard or capo as well.\n\n\"The Tattooist of Auschwitz\" by Heather Morris is based upon the harrowing experiences of Lale Sokolov in Auschwitz and Birkenau. The chilling accounts of total disregard for life are occasionally tempered by selfless goodness and sacrifice without which Lale and Gita's love story could not have been told. This slim tome documents less familiar aspects of Holocaust literature. A must read.\n\nThank you Bonnier Zaffre and Net Galley for the opportunity to read and review \"The Tattooist of Auschwitz\".\nShow more",

            "content": "The Tattooist of Auschwitz (The Tattooist of Auschwitz #1), Heather Morris\n\nIn April 1942, Lale Sokolov, a Slovakian Jew, is forcibly transported to the concentration camps at Auschwitz-Birkenau. When his captors discover that he speaks several languages, he is put to work as a T towierer (the German word for tattooist), tasked with permanently marking his fellow prisoners. Imprisoned for more than two and a half years, Lale witnesses horrific atrocities and barbarism but also incredible acts of bravery and compassion.\n\nRisking his own life, he uses his privileged position to exchange jewels and money from murdered Jews for food to keep his fellow prisoners alive. One day in July 1942, Lale, prisoner 32407, comforts a trembling young woman waiting in line to have the number 34902 tattooed onto her arm. Her name is Gita, and in that first encounter, Lale vows to somehow survive the camp and marry her.\n\nA vivid, harrowing, and ultimately hopeful re-creation of Lale Sokolov's experiences as the man who tattooed the arms of thousands of prisoners with what would become one of the most potent symbols of the Holocaust, The Tattooist of Auschwitz is also a testament to the endurance of love and humanity under the darkest possible conditions.\n\n                         :                                           :     (    )                          :                           2019      \n\n     :                        :     (    )             :                                             1397    261       9786004611992       :                                             -    21 \n\n     :                        :     (    )             :                                                 :            1397    271       9786008066972             1397                               1398    271       9786226220361  \n\n     :                       :                                                      1397    266       9786226202435 \n\n     :                        :     (    )                                                  1398    148       9786226247702  \n\n     :                        :                                                    1398    262       9786226199247  \n\n     :                       :                                                    1398    295       9786004053327                                                                     \n\n                               (    )                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1942                                                    -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       -                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ...

            "content": "This is an incredible book with a story that demands to be heard.\n\nThe year is 2018 and it gladdens me that books like this are still being written. It s important that we never forget Auschwitz and that we never forget the war crimes Nazi Germany committed. Why? Because we need to know and understand what humanity is capable of, we need to know what extreme hate looks like so we can work towards building a world free from it. This is one of our darkest hours, and we need to remember it.\n\nThis is a true story. The characters were real people. They were plucked from the mind of a dying old man (who is also the protagonist) who wanted his story to be heard by the world. It took him over seventy years to muster the courage to tell it, Morris is the instrument of his words. So this isn t a book that dramatises the events or capitalises on the situation in order to sell a thrilling piece of fiction; it simply portrays the horrors as they were: it doesn t need to be exaggerated because it is in itself so horrifyingly real. We all know about Auschwitz, though there is something intimate about this particular story.\n\n\n\nLale was the man responsible for tattooing identity numbers onto new entries into Auschwitz. It s a role he hated, one where he felt like a collaborator as he defiled the bodies of innocent with the ink of the enemy, though it is also a role that afforded him many benefits. He was given a position of trust and was able to move around the camps at will. As such he smuggled in extra food rations for those that needed it most. He brought them medicine and aid whenever he could, consolation for living apart from those that suffered the most.\n\nThe narrative was incredibly tense because death was never far away. All it took was one annoyed guard to raise his rifle and pull his trigger, and that s it: it s all over. Death came randomly. There was no system, just merciless killing at the whim of the oppressors. Doctor Mendel (Doctor Death) was the best example. He was an evil man, cold and fear inducing. Whenever he entered a scene the trepidation of the characters was palpable. It s like the temperature dropped. Morris did wonders to capture the presence of such a callous man.\n\nWith all darkness, there comes light. In the depths of the death camp there is also life, love and family: three things we all need to stay alive. Despite how cruelly the Jews were treated, despite how far they were objectified and made to feel less than human, they still managed to cling onto their identities and the very things that make them who they are. Hope endured for some, hope that they would some day be liberated and have the opportunity to begin a new life. And that s exactly what makes the hero of the novel so compelling. He never looses his optimism. He never stops trying to help people.\n\n\n\nHis love for his wife Gita kept him from dropping dead. And it wasn t until she died in real life, many years later, that he released their story. And it s very powerful one.\n\n| | | |\nShow more",

            "content": "This is a very, very difficult book to review.\n\nThere are certain books that tell a story so important that it overrides other aspects of itself, and therefore can overcome certain narrative shortcomings. The Hate U Give, for example, may not have been the most well-written thing I ve ever read, nor will the characters stay with me forever - but the story will.\n\nI m in a similar situation here.\n\nThis is the story of Lale, a Jewish man who became the tattooist at Auschwitz and used the relative privileges this position allowed him to feed himself and others, fall in love, make friends, and ultimately survive.\n\nLale is a real man, and this is a true story, but in spite of the fact that Heather Morris interviewed Lale in order to capture it, this is still categorized as historical fiction. And that categorization shows.\n\nI read a lot of reviews of this in order to figure out how to explain my inability to fall in love with it, and a line resonated with me:  I can't help but wonder if viewing concentration camps with the rose colored glasses Lale seemed to wear is damaging to the way some readers will think of the holocaust experience. \n\nLike many modern readers, I ve read lots of stories of the Holocaust, and been shocked and horrified by each one. This is the first I ve encountered that didn t seem to focus first on the suffering and evils of it.\n\nAbove all, this is a love story. And while that s beautiful, and for many may inspire faith in humanity and the human experience, I felt some small amount of discomfort.\n\nThe Tattooist of Auschwitz skips and glosses over some of the greatest horrors of the Holocaust (one of the most nightmarish events in human history) and of Lale s time in one of the most gruesome concentration camps, and instead focuses, unrelentingly and always, on the romance.\n\nI think Lale s remarkable, miraculous story deserved to be told, and I m happy Heather Morris did so, and often did so adeptly, but I worry about upholding stories of the Holocaust in which the major takeaway is love and joy and happily ever after.\n\nThere are upsides to this, but we should never forget the truth of what it was.\n\nBottom line: Lale is a remarkable man who likely saved an unknowable number of people, and I m grateful I now know his story. I just wish I d read it in a work of nonfiction.\n\n\n---------\n\ni'm ready to have my heart stomped on\nShow more",

            "content": " Based on an incredible true story  as this states on the cover, this is the story of Lale Sokolov and Gita, the woman who he meets at Auschwitz, both prisoners there. At first Lale is working on a roof, and this is what he does for a while until his kapo says he needs a boy to do his bidding, run errands, bring him food and the like. Then fate intervenes somewhat again for Lale when he becomes the tattooist, the T towierer for both Auschwitz and Birkenau, a position under the Political Wing that answers only to Berlin.\n\nHe meets Gita, whom he only knows by the number he tattooed to her arm, no words exchanged of course. A slip of paper with the number that was to be permanently marked on her skin were the only words that accompanied her. Eventually, he manages to introduce himself through channels and messages passed. Eventually an infatuation turns to love.\n\n\n\nBut love is not the only emotion he feels there, having to stand by as the likes of Mengele get pleasure from inflicting terror and humiliation on all, but especially the female prisoners. Impotent rage, horror, fear, sympathy and an overwhelming sense of powerlessness engulf him, not only for him, but for all those prisoners subjected to the torture, abuse, humiliation.\n\n\n\nI ve never been to Auschwitz or Birkenau, but many years ago I went to Dachau when I was in Munich on business. A group of us went there together, even the memory it still makes it hard for me to breathe. Photographs of the conditions, of how it appeared for those who were held captive   not so much living, but barely existing there. Each had their own stories, but we don t often have access to an account such as this one, which makes it all the more important. That these people are more than just numbers to be totaled, they are people who loved, who were loved and had hopes and dreams.\n\nMy deepest respect goes to the author for having the compassion and emotional stamina to hear these stories directly from Lale Sokolov, and bring these stories to us in such a truly lovely ode to love and the will to survive. Lale s story broke my heart into a hundred pieces and then you somehow managed to put it back together again in this poignant story of the saving grace of a love found even in the darkest of times.\n\n\nPublished: 01 Feb 2018\n\nMany thanks for the ARC provided by Bonnier Publishing Australia / Echo\nShow more",

            "content": "Reviewing a novel about the Holocaust on Holocaust Remembrance day seems both apropos, and a great responsibility. Never forget! As long as there are people who need to tell! Their stories, I will continue to read and remember. This is a fictionalized account of a true story, told to the author in the final days of his life. Lale was a young Jewish man from Slovakia, with much to look forward to, when in an effort to save the rest of his family, he is taken to Auschwitz. There he will become the tattooist, the man who tattoos those horrendous numbers on the prisoners arms. A prestigious job in the camp that gives him priviledges many don't have, also a certain freedom. How he uses this freedom is a big part of the story. A story with many horrors terrors and yes even love.\n\nI dislike rating these stories. I always feel like I am rating, in this case, a man's life, passing judgement on his horrifying experiences. They were, but this young man was fortunate, not a good word to use obviously, in many instances that found others either shot or beaten to death. He had a sunny personality and vowed to survive the camp, maybe the reason the tone of this was more light than many others of the camps that I have read. Maybe this is the story he needed to remember to survive, only he can know that. The writing is less emotional than some, a kind of storytelling tone, which I guess makes sense as the author was telling a story. For me though, often times, I felt an emotional disconnect. It is though, impossible not to like Lale, he indeed uses his position, well. We meet other important characters, the young woman who he would come to love, her friends. Some of the guards, and all play their parts in this story.\n\nI do love how at the end of the book the author lets the reader know what happened to some of the main people in this novel. One young women's fate I found particularly unfair. At the end there is an added bonus and it is here that I felt all the emotions I had been missing.

            "content": "On Writing a Romance Set in an Extermination Camp\n\nA note: as I keep getting notifications and occasional comments about this review, I can't help myself from rereading it once in a while too, however painful the subject matter. I suppose it has real therapeutic value for me. Today Nov 4/19 I felt the need to summarize my current feelings about this book, as I exchange impressions about it with other readers. It tapped into a very heavy legacy countless humans have to carry; descendants and their loved ones and all the sympathisers, whether consciously or not. Some of us feel that burden more heavily than others.\n\n  I am disgusted. And angry. And extremely upset. I was trying to determine whether I should continue till the end so I could count this book as one of my yearly reads considering how much of it I've endured so far, but f*ckit, it does count. I'm DNFing this book at 74% because I consider I've read enough of it to get a good sense of what it's about, what the author's intention was, how she handled her material, the historic period (the Holocaust from 1942 to the liberation) and place (Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp).\n\nHere was my comment at the 30% mark as I was listening to the audiobook: (Bird Box)\n\nOne of the reasons for this, is that my father's relatives were Polish Jews, a very large family, most of whom died in Auschwitz-Birkenau. At least, I am assuming that is where they where sent, but of course I shouldn t assume anything. There were six extermination camps in Poland, and Jews were often transported in cattle carts on long train rides that could last days. And of course, who has the heart to look up old records, if there are any to be found (though we know the Germans were very thorough)?\n\nAs a young child, I spent several years in Israel attending a series of public schools as we moved around, my parents separately being nomads by nature. It was an vastly enriching multicultural experience for me, being a curious child interested in history and arts and language and people and culture in general. But I also had the great 'privilege' and dubious delight of being traumatized for life by being taken to holocaust museums and encouraged to watch Nazi footage of the Jewish Ghettos and then the Nazi \"Work Camps\". This was some four decades ago now. I saw with my own eyes the moving images of living corpses gathered against the fences in those worn out, much too large striped pyjamas. Followed by panning images on the piles upon piles of naked things, no more than skin tightly stretched over bones with skulls attached. There were also little piles of human hair and teeth, I remember a 40s style lamp shade made with human skin, bars of soap, and so on, all of these displays helpfully accompanied with little cards with helpful details about what the items were and how they'd been harvested. All neatly protected under glass cases, so that generations later, we would \"Never Forget\". I never forgot. No, no. I never did. How I dreaded those class excursions. Who wouldn't?\n\nAt the audiobook's 74% mark, I wanted to post the following update, but the character count was over the allowed limit of 420 characters. That was somehow the tipping point which made me decide I was with this book:\nRomance\n\n... So, the update is I've looked up Morris's short biography here on GR, and seems she had the best of intentions. But you know what they say about the road to hell...\n\nThere was a headline the other day about the fact that young Canadians know little to nothing about the Holocaust nowadays, and of course I found this shocking and sad and very disturbing. And then when I shared this tidbit with my partner, he had the extremely bad taste to tell me that soon, to appease what will become a Muslim majority here, they will minimize the teachings on the Holocaust and emphasize the Crusades. He is left-brained and prides himself on being a scientist and a stoic and all such stuff to justify saying insensitive things at the wrong moments. Which seems to be a specialty with men in general, or the types I seem to be attracted to, for some reason.\n\nI partly feel that book which brings the Holocaust to public awareness is important, and that we can't saddle every novelist with the responsibility of being a documentarian, but in such cases, the author has no business claiming the novel is based on a true story when it simply isn't. The man who related the events told in this biographical novel was well into his 80s when he did so, and it is glaringly obvious that his memory had rewritten large swaths of his own history by then, and many times over.\n\nThe story here is so clearly exaggerated it beggars belief. Here, Lale, the Tattooist in question is so filled with confidence and charm he manages to gather a real treasure trove of gems as camp detainee, and obtains endless favourable treatment for everyone under his protection, including the almost unthinkable treasure of life-sustaining extra foodstuff (and chocolate no less!) to distribute around generously... Some parts of his tale were no doubt based on true events, but to me he seemed manipulative more than sympathetic, and his successes multiplied untill it between the both of them, the made the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camps as fairy tale experiencse compared to what I'd heard of it in my childhood days and ever since. I know there were relatively many considering the odds, that is who survived the camps, and I know most of those survivors were per force ingenious, charming, and/or incredibly lucky to survive at all, but this story was over the top and seriously beggared belief.\n\nBut you don't have to take my word for it. Here are a couple of articles that seem to mostly agree with my point of view too:\n\n\n\n\nI was going to give this a whole two stars because I was so angry when I started writing this review, and then I simmered down and could see how some readers might enjoy this book. But my initial gut feeling about the terrible insult to all those souls who suffered so horribly, of creating a sort of fairytale in the very death camps and next to the very gas chambers and cremation ovens and the barracks and factories and clinics and endless daily brutalities until their final violent destructions came about... came literally haunting me back. And the descendants of their surviving relatives, for whom the merest suggestion of those times are still a wrenching and tearing deep inside our spirits and at the very core of our material bodies, this is no light matter. She simply had no right to this material. None at all. So no. I'd give it minuses if it were possible. A well-meaning European friend who often reads books I like recommended it to me, and yes, I see objectively what people loved about it, because there is all that hope, of love flourishing amid all that death and destruction, of surviving against all odds, of that love lasting a lifetime. I get all that. I do. But context matters. Intention matters. Who delivers the story matters. Humility matters. And as a descendant of survivors and a survivor myself, I say, we should start doing better.\nShow more",

            "content": "What a powerful novel! More so since it's based on a true story, the life of Lale Sokolov while a prisoner in Auschwitz/Birkenau.\n\nI never want to forget about the Holocaust and fiction books based on it are always found on the top of my TBR. I've read many non-fiction books about it over the years and I'm always affected by the lack of humanity by the nazis and the perseverance of the imprisoned.\n\nLale Sokolov was taken in April 1942 when he was a young man. He was living with his parents in Krompachy, Slovakia when his sister brings a poster her boss had given her to place in the shop window. The announcement said that each Jewish family had to give up a son aged eighteen or older to work for the Germans. Lale surrenders himself instead of his older brother Max and he's taken to Auschwitz/Birkenau.\n\nAfter arriving, Lale makes a promise that he will survive whatever the concentration camp sends his way. With his knowledge of different languages, he's soon placed to become the Tatowierer. It takes pieces of his soul to mark other human beings but he is just doing what all prisoners were trying to do: to survive.\n\nAs the Tatowierer, he has more food rations and he can move more freely.

            "content": "The Tattooist of Auschwitz is a compelling and unforgettable story of hope and courage that is so beautifully written based on interviews with Holocaust Survivor Auschwitz-Birkenau Tattooist Ludwig (Lale) Sokolov. Lale with compassion and sensitivity, tattoos numbers on the arms of prisoners. While doing this he forms a connection with Gita that leads to a tender and charming love story.\n\nHeather Morris does a good job capturing the life of Lale and the conditions he lived with, without adding unnecessary graphic scenes that we all really appreciated here. At times the story is dark and haunting and we really could feel the heartbreak of the horrific setting of this story. We also felt hope in the love and affection Lale and Gita had for each other in such dark times. Some of us did feel the love story seemed hard to believe under such horrific conditions but still allowed us to feel hope in times that seemed so hopeless.\n\nThis is Lale s account of what he needed to do to survive with dignity and I am so glad I got the chance to hear this uplifting and inspiring story of courage and love. I hope you all do too and I highly recommend.\n\nTraveling Sister Read\n\nThank you NetGalley, Bonnier Publishing and Heather Morris for a copy to read and review.\n\nShow more",

He was a likable man went by the rules to stay alive, but also suffered the brutal beatings due to his jewells he had hidden in his bag. He eventually became the tattooist which he hated as it was inflicting pain on others that he didnt like, but then he met Gita the girl of his dreams he tattoed her & they became lovers.\n\n\nLale then got onside with & S S soldier Baretski he wouyld do favours for & visa versa, but when men women & children are taken in the night without any warning fear grips Gita & her friends, eventually Cilka had to sleep with the head guards just to stay alive this was terrible but in the end she did what she did to survive the attrocities of Auschwitz she was a survivor but many didnt make it.\n\n\nThis strory had to be told both Lale & Gita are strong even though at times you saw weakness it was a harrowing read & at times i i felt anger at what Lale, Gita & their friends had to endure. THIS IS A MUST READ!!\n\nI will never read a more powerful story again this year this would have to be my favourite book of 2019.\nShow more",

My heart opened up and welcomed Lale in from the first page of this powerful story.\n\nThis is a truly unforgettable story of one man s journey of survival through one of the most horrendous and appalling times in our history   Nazi concentration camp, Auschwitz. Lale Sokolov survived the brutal hell known as Auschwitz for over two years where his  job  was to tattoo prisoners with their identifying number. What he endured and witnessed is nothing short of horrific and devastating.\n\nThe author, Heather Morris, did an outstanding job giving Lale a voice. I will not ever forget reading this life changing and emotional story. How wonderful that Lale s legacy will live on through the wonderful work of Heather Morris. It is so important that stories like this are not forgotten.\n\nThis was a Traveling Sister read which really enhanced the experience for me.

            "content": "I m always reluctant to read works of fiction dealing with the Holocaust - although I ve read my fair share. It s not that I find it too hard to read about atrocities, it s that I worry that unless they are done right, fictional accounts run the risk of trivializing this horrific chapter in human history.\n\nThe Tattooist of Auschwitz reads like fiction, but is based on interviews the author conducted with its protagonist, Lale Sokolov, over a three year period very late in Lale s life. A Jew transported from Slovakia to Auschwitz, Lale survived almost three years before the end of the war. For most of that time, he was assigned the task of tattooing numbers on the arms of Jews being brought into the camp. This gave him a bit of a privileged position in terms of food and housing, and also allowed him to move a bit more freely so he was able to develop a relationship with another prisoner, Gita, who is also a survivor. They married after the war.\n\nThe genesis of how Lale came to tell the author his story includes an admonition not to judge him until she heard the whole story. And this points to the core of Lale s story. What does it take to survive in a place like Auschwitz? After, once you ve survived, what rationalizations are required to stave off the guilt of surviving when so many died?\n\nUltimately, while it s based in real historical events, The Tattooist of Auschwitz reads like a work of fiction. It is Lale s recollection of his life during World War II as he has told it to himself. It reads like fiction because at times it does feel a bit romanticized or smoothed over around the edges. The atrocities are there, but Lale s strong spirit and survival instinct seem larger than life.\n\nThis isn t a criticism and I am not judging Lale. I suspect all survivors have to make sense of what it took to survive. I also suspect that they judge themselves far more harshly than anyone else does. I m grateful to have had a chance to read about Lale and Gita s story and I m happy to know that they were able to make sense of their horrific experience and live happily for many years after the Holocaust. Their story is well worth reading.\n\nThanks to Netgalley and the publisher for an opportunity to read an advance copy.\nShow more",

            "content": "4 utterly unforgettable stars to The Tattooist of Auschwitz            \n\nThis is the story of Lale and Gita Sokolov, two Slovakian prisoners at Auschwitz who fell in love and all the risks and sacrifices made by them and others to keep them alive and together.\n\nIt all began with Lale and how he was chosen to be the person who tattoos numbers on the prisoners at Auschwitz and Birkenau. As one can imagine, this was heartbreaking work; but as Pepau (a fellow tattooist) told Lale, at least it was being done by someone with a heart. Through this job, Lale had favor at prison and ended up sharing the wealth with as many prisoners as he could. Lale ran into Gita, a woman he has met before, prior to being imprisoned, and their love grew from there.\n\nLale and Gita offered a unique and complex perspective on the Holocaust. At first, I was taken aback by their story and the extreme peril they risked by being together. But then it made me wonder if there were any other stories like Lale and Gita s? Others who jeopardized their lives for love while living in impossible and incredibly dire circumstances?\n\nOverall, I loved this book. Lale s positive spirit, humanity, and courage grabbed hold of my heart. I m grateful he told his story.\n\nThank you to Heather Morris, Bonnier Publishing, and Netgalley, for the complimentary copy to review.\n\nShow more",

            "content": "I am aware that this book has caused a little bit of controversy amongst the book readers of the world. The criticism is that it romanticizes the war, and in particular, life at the brutal Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp in Poland. This book is a work of fiction based upon stories passed to the author by a survivor, and the main character in the book, Lale Sokolov. Lale was transported to Auschwitz in 1942 from his homeland, Slovakia. My review and opinion of this book is based purely on what I think of the story and ignores the apparent controversy as I have said before, I read for my own pleasure and if I feel a book to be in poor taste, I simply will not read it.\n\nLale quickly becomes the tattooist in Auschwitz after he is transported there in 1942. He is responsible for the reprehensible task of tattooing the incoming prisoners with the numbers on their inner forearms. This is a job that is viewed as aligning with the Germans and helping their war effort when in reality, it is an unavoidable job that someone must do and Lale sees it as his way of staying alive as long as possible.\n\nThe Tattooist of Auschwitz is a harrowing story of life in Aushwitz-Birkenau over a three year period, from 1942 until the Russian army eventually breaks through the German lines in 1945. It is a story of hope in the bleakest environment imaginable, and yes there is a core element of romance. But I like to view the relationship to be a big Fuck You to the Germans, a relationship that is taboo in a prison camp between two people just holding on to the threads of life.\n\nFor those of you who don't want to face the horrors of what went on here in WWII, I can assure you that the violence is kept at a minimum although there are some necessary occasions. Anyone who reads this book and takes an interest in just how Auschwitz-Birkenau came about, was run and what happened there, I can absolutely recommend the book Auschwitz by Laurence Rees.\nShow more",

            "content": "The Tattooist of Auschwitz is a tragically prime example of how powerfully moving source material can turn to complete and utter mush in the hands of the wrong storyteller.\n\nI m aware that I am likely to be censured for this rating, not simply because it lurks amid a plethora of glowing reviews, but because this novel is based on the truth, and what a horrific truth. Anything even vaguely biographical can be so challenging to review; it s someone s afterall. That being said, simply because a work is inspired by a true story does not in any way, shape or form render it untouchable or immune to criticism. So for anyone poised to attack me with that specious argument: your attempts will be in vain.\n\nLale s story existed as a screenplay manuscript for twelve years and quite frankly, I think it should have stayed that way. I genuinely believe that Morris lacks understanding of basic sentence structure. To say she evidently struggles with prose would be an understatement; the writing is simply appalling. It is too crude and piecemeal to be even amateur. Morris relies heavily on excessive filter words, which dilute her narrative, as well as exposition and painfully trite stock phrases;   ,    ,    etc. etc. Other phrases and word choices frequently belied the tone you would expect from an extermination camp; describing SS officers as   , fears of being labelled a    or the interminable focus on    in an effort to make the book somewhat gritty and honest. The result is that it lacks a fundamental credibility and feels somewhat insincere. Morris s writing is far too prosaic to be either emotive, suspenseful or convincing; the novel is shockingly sedate considering what harrowing events occur.\n\nPerhaps the greatest sin in my opinion is that a genuinely moving relationship translates onto the page as nothing more than a cloying, fanciful and saccharine romance - and that s why this book made me gag a little. In essence, the characterization is agonisingly poor. Morris does a fundamental disservice to both Lale and Gita in the sense that their fictional selves lack both agency and dimension. Neither are given the opportunity to flourish into individuals or to gain even a twitch of personality. Give me one character trait of Gita, go on, I dare you. The romance escalates unrealistically quickly and it s certainly never emotionally compelling given that the two don t appear to connect on any sort of psychological level. The wince-inducing love lessons (chocolate and flowers will answer all your relationship problems, apparently) and ridiculous sex scenes reduce to little more than a farce. The romance doesn t the page. The characters, plot and writing certainly don't either.\n\nWhat guts me the most is that this story had such potential. Morris missed opportunities to develop this beyond the surface; she doesn t explore the complexity and reality of rape, assault, trauma, and sacrifice. She neglects to endow this piece with any sort of dimension, period, so it reads more like bad fanfiction than a sincere tribute. Ultimately, the execution doesn t do any justice to what should be a thoroughly compelling and unique piece. Instead the novel lacks authority, plausibility and gravity. I genuinely believe that this could truly have been something special under the auspices of a more capable writer. As it stands, something that should in theory have been incredibly moving, quite simply, wasn t.\nShow more",
